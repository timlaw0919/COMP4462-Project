The aim was to decrease thedependence of the economy on imported energy. Another reason is the Kyoto Protocol whichaims at decreasing global warming. According to the Kyoto Protocol the main reason for globalwarming is increased emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHG). Many industrialized countries haveratiﬁed the protocol, committing to reduce GHG emissions. The main policy to achieve it hasbeen to reduce the domestic energy consumption ( de Nooij, van der Kurk, & van Soest, 2003 ).\\nHowever, if economic growth is inﬂuenced by the amount of energy as well as primary inputs (i.e.labor and capital) ( Beaudreau, 2005 ;Stern & Cleveland, 2003 ), then increasing economic growth\\nand reducing GHG emissions may appear to be two conﬂicting goals. On the other hand, thereappears to be a wide variety of different policy options to ﬁght global warming and to mitigateits adverse effects (see, for example, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,UN FCCC, 2004 ). Such policies include decreasing energy intensity, switching from fossil fuels\\nto cleaner sources, using fossil fuels more efﬁciently, increasing forestation to overcome affects ofdeforestation due to ﬁrewood consumption, changing life styles to promote energy conservation,developing a market for emissions trading, etc. ( UN FCCC, 2004 ). The relevant action by each\\ncountry is to choose the most appropriate option(s) according to the characteristics of its economy.To implement the most appropriate policy without hindering economic growth requires identifyingthe nature of the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. This paperattempts to shed more light on the energy consumption and economic growth relations in G-7countries that may provide more information to the policy makers in these countries in choosingfrom a wide variety of policy options in line with the Kyoto Protocol.\\nSeveral time series studies have investigated the relationship between energy consumption and\\nincome, but unanimous results were not reached. The lack of consensus may be largely due tothe differences in the development stages of the various countries studied or the differences inthe data and the methodologies employed. However, even studies focusing on the same countriessometimes yield different results. As for the differences in methodologies, they may be roughlycategorized into two: use of either a bivariate or a multivariate framework. Although, bivariateGranger causality tests have been criticized due to a possible omitted variables bias, multivariatestudies also yielded conﬂicting results. One possible reason for the lack of consensus in multi-variate studies on the same countries may be that the choice of control variables was arbitrary.\\nIn the light of these concerns, we investigate the relationship between energy consumption and\\nincome in each G-7 country, employing multivariate time series data, while controlling the changesin traditional factors of production. We were able to uncover Granger causality in all G-7 countries;hence, the policy makers should avoid evaluating economic growth, energy consumption, andemission reduction policies independent from each other.\\nIf causality is running from energy consumption to growth, then energy conservation may harm\\neconomic growth. In such cases, countries may choose to invest in technology that discovers andmakes alternative energy sources economically feasible, in the meantime following policies thatmitigate carbon emissions such as increasing energy efﬁciency and decreasing energy intensityvia substituting in cleaner (i.e. natural gas, solar, wind energy) sources for fossil fuels like coaland oil. On the other hand, if there is uni-directional causality running in the opposite direction,then decreasing domestic energy consumption and encouraging energy conservation may becomethe key actions in reducing domestic emissions. Finally, if there is bi-directional causality, then acarefully integrated mixture of alternative policy actions may be possible.U. Soytas, R. Sari / Journal of Policy Modeling 28 (2006) 739–750 741\\nIn the next two sections, we provide a brief review of the empirical literature and discuss the\\nrelevant theoretical background. Then we describe the data and data sources, and then we discussthe unit root and cointegration test results. We continue with the Granger causality tests in VECframework and in generalized variance decompositions (as out of sample causality tests). The lastsection provides policy implications and conclusions.\\n2. Literature review\\nMost of the earlier work, starting with the pioneering paper by Kraft and Kraft (1978) , con-\\nducted Granger causality tests between energy and income ( Abosedra & Baghestani, 1991 ;Akarca\\n& Long, 1980 ;Bentzen & Engsted, 1993 ;Erol & Yu, 1987 ;Glasure & Lee, 1997 ;Hwang & Gum,\\n1992 ;Yu & Choi, 1985 ;Yu & Hwang, 1984 ). The earlier studies were far from establishing styl-\\nized facts in that they reported different results for different countries and even different results forthe same country for different time periods. More recent studies have incorporated relatively newtime series techniques, such as cointegration and vector error correction modeling to overcomethe stationarity problem inherent in the traditional tests ( Altinay & Karagol, 2004 ;Asafu-Adjaye,\\n2000 ;Ghali and El-Sakka, 2004 ;Glasure, 2002 ;Lee, 2005, 2006 ;Masih & Masih, 1996, 1997,\\n1998 ;Narayan & Smyth, 2005 ;Oh & Lee, 2004 ;Sari & Soytas, 2004 ;Soytas & Sari, 2003 ;Stern,\\n1993, 2000 ;Wolde-Rufael, 2004, 2005 ;Yang, 2000 ). However, there still does not seem to be a\\nconsensus on whether causality exists between energy consumption and output or not, and on thedirection of causality if it exists.\\nStern (2000) ,Asafu-Adjaye (2000) andGlasure (2002) point out the importance of omitted\\nvariables and they suggest a multivariate empirical analysis. Although multivariate analysis iscommonly used in the recent literature, there does not seem to be a theoretical background in mostof the studies. Hence, a variety of macro variables have been considered in studies that investigatethe relationship between income and energy. Probably a more formal treatment is provided inGhali and El-Sakka (2004) . They assume a neo-classical one sector production function with\\nthree inputs for Canada and ﬁnd bi-directional causality between energy use and output. Theirresults do not seem to conﬁrm the neo-classical assumption of neutrality of energy to growth.\\n3. Theoretical background\\nBeaudreau (2005) argues that the engineering and economic views of production have differ-\\nences as well as similarities. He criticizes the traditional growth accounting for treating energy asa secondary factor and points out that for an engineer production is not possible without energyuse. From an economist’s perspective this calls for considering energy as an important input forproduction. Indeed several studies in the literature seem to support this belief. Beaudreau (1995) ,\\nGhali and El-Sakka (2004) andStern (1997, 2000) all appear to incorporate energy consumption\\nin a production function framework to analyze the relationship between energy consumption andoutput.\\nIn this paper, we examine the relationship between energy consumption and output in a three\\nfactor (KLE) production function framework in G-7 countries. As it was formulized in Ghali and\\nEl-Sakka (2004) :\\nY\\nt=f(Kt,Lt,Et) (1)742 U. Soytas, R. Sari / Journal of Policy Modeling 28 (2006) 739–750\\nwhere tis time trend, Ythe real output, Kthe capital stock, Lthe total labor and Eis the energy\\nconsumption. The differential of Eq. (1)is\\ndYt=YKdKt+YLdLt+YEdEt (2)\\nwhere YK,YLand YErefers to the partial derivatives of Ywith respect to capital stock, total labor\\nand energy consumption, respectively. The division of Eq. (2)with Ytand rearrangement of the\\nresults gives the following growth equation:\\n˙Yt=b1˙Kt+b2˙Lt+b3˙Et (3)\\nwhere the variables are in a growth rate form as indicated by the dots on top of them. Eq.\\n(3)suggests that three is a long run equilibrium relationship between the variables. Hence, past\\nobservations on growth of inputs and energy consumption may improve the forecasts of economicgrowth. In the light of Eq. (3), we investigate the temporal relationship between energy consump-\\ntion and economic growth while controlling for growth rates of traditional production factors.\\n4. Data\\nWe use annual time series data sourced from the World Development Indicators (WDI) for all\\nG-7 countries. The period of the data covered varies from as long as 44 years for most variables(1960–2004) to as low as 32 years (1971–2003 for some German data and 1970–2002 for someFrench data). We use total labor force and total energy use (kilotonnes of oil equivalent) anddenote them as Land E, respectively. For income ( Y) we use real GDP per capita (US$ 2000). The\\ncapital stock ( K) data is difﬁcult, if not impossible, to obtain. There is no readily available dataset\\nfor it. However, if I\\ntis the investment at time tandδis depreciation rate, then the aggregate capital\\nstock is calculated by Kt=( 1−δ)Kt−1+It, which is called perpetual inventory method ( Jacob,\\nSharma, & Grabowski, 1997 ). This equation implies that the variance in capital is mostly related\\nto the change in investment if the depreciation rate is constant. Thus, following Jin and Yu (1996)\\nandShan and Sun (1998) among others, we employ growth of real gross ﬁxed capital formation\\n(US$ 2000) as a reliable proxy for growth of capital stock. The variables employed in this paperare similar to those commonly used in the literature (see, for example, Beaudreau, 1995 ;Ghali\\n& El-Sakka, 2004 ;Narayan & Smyth, 2005 ;Soytas & Sari, 2003 ). Note that all variables are in\\nnatural logarithms so that their ﬁrst differences approximate their growth rates. We use Lin front\\nof each variable to indicate the natural logarithm.\\n5. Methods and results\\nWe employ Johansen (1991, 1995) andJohansen–Juselius (1990) cointegration\\n2test, vec-\\ntor error correction model (VECM) and generalized variance decomposition of Koop, Pesaran,\\nand Potter (1996) andPesaran and Shin (1998) . The time series properties of the series were\\nchecked by ﬁve different unit root tests.3And also, three different lag selection procedures\\n2SeeGonzalo (1994) andHubrich, Lutkepohl, and Saikkonen (2001) for a review and comparison of methods.\\n3Namely, augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) ( Dickey & Fuller, 1979 ), Dickey–Fuller GLS detrended (DF-GLS) ( Elliott,\\nRothenberg, & Stock, 1996 ), Phillips–Perron (PP) ( Phillips & Perron, 1988 ), Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin\\n(KPSS) ( Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, & Shin, 1992 ) and Ng and Perron (2001) MZ/H9251test (NP) (see Maddala &\\nKim, 1998 for excellent treatment of ADF, PP, KPSS and DF-GLS; and Ng & Perron, 2001 for NP).U. Soytas, R. Sari / Journal of Policy Modeling 28 (2006) 739–750 743\\nwere employed.4There does not appear to be overwhelming statistical evidence to deny that\\nall variables are integrated of order 1. The results of the cointegration tests, maximum eigen-value and the trace statistics, for all seven countries show that for all countries there existsat least one cointegrating equation.\\n5Existence of at least one cointegrating equation for each\\ncountry suggests that Granger causality exists but it does not indicate the direction. In orderto assess which variables Granger cause others and vice versa we refer to VEC modeling.If the variables in concern are cointegrated, a vector error correction model should be esti-mated rather than a V AR as in a standard Granger causality test. Following Engle and Granger\\n(1987) andGranger (1969) , we formulate the following VEC representation for each country as\\nfollows:\\n/Delta1LY\\nt=µ1+α1,1ECT 1,t−1+α1,2ECT 2,t−1+···+ α1,iECTi,t−1+p/summationdisplay\\ns=1γ1,s/Delta1LYt−s\\n+p/summationdisplay\\ns=1γ2,s/Delta1LKt−s+p/summationdisplay\\ns=1γ3,s/Delta1LLt−s+p/summationdisplay\\ns=1γ4,s/Delta1LEt−s+ε1,t (4)\\n/Delta1LEt=µ4+α4,1ECT 1,t−1+α4,2ECT 2,t−1+···+ α4,iECTi,t−1+g/summationdisplay\\ns=1λ1,s/Delta1LYt−s\\n+g/summationdisplay\\ns=1λ2,s/Delta1LKt−s+g/summationdisplay\\ns=1λ4,s/Delta1LLt−s+g/summationdisplay\\ns=1λ5,s/Delta1LEt−s+ε4,t (5)\\nwhere ECT irefer to error correction term(s) derived from long run cointegrating relationships,\\nµ1andµ2the intercepts, and p,l,h,gand fare the lag lengths. The symbol ( /Delta1) denotes the\\ndifference of the variable following it.\\nSources of causation between the variables in one equation ( (4)and(5)) can be identiﬁed\\nthrough three channels: (i) the lagged ECTs (as) by a t-test; (ii) the coefﬁcients of each explanatory\\nvariable in one equation (weak or short run Granger causality); (iii) the terms in (i) and (ii) jointly(strong or long run Granger causality). Table 1 presents the Granger causality test results.\\nThe results for Canada imply bi-directional Granger causality between LE and LY both in the\\nshort and the long run, supporting Ghali and El-Sakka (2004) . The results indicate that energy\\nconsumption, investment and labor adjust to restore the long run equilibrium relationship wheneverthere is a deviation from the equilibrium cointegrating relationship. For France although theredoes not appear to be short run causality between LE and LY , income appear to bear the burdenof adjustment towards the long run equilibrium in response to a short run deviation. This resultis consistent with ﬁndings reported in Soytas and Sari’s (2003) bivariate analyses. The results\\nimply uni-directional causality running from income to energy in both the short and long runs inGermany. Energy consumption seems to restore the long run equilibrium relationship alone.

The short and long\\nrun causality results of Japan are similar to those of Italy and Germany. Evidence from the UKsupport causality relationship only from income to energy in the short run, but in both directionsin the long run. The results imply that causality is uni-directional and running from energy toincome in US in both the short and the long runs. Investment and income act together to restore thelong run equilibrium whenever a short run innovation shocks the system. Hence, we ﬁnd evidenceagainst the neutrality of energy. Only in the case of France, the relationship between energy andincome appears to be weak and indirect, providing some support for Erol and Yu (1987) in the\\nshort run. Although our results support Erol and Yu (1987) andSoytas and Sari (2003) results\\npartially for some countries, and Stern (1993, 2000) results fully, they seem to be contradicting\\nKraft and Kraft (1978) ,Erol and Yu (1987) , Abosedra and Baghestani (1991), Yu and Jin (1992) ,\\nCheng (1995) andLee (2006) .\\nShort run causality runs from income to energy consumption in Germany, Italy, Japan and UK;\\nfrom energy use to income in the US; and both ways in Canada. The only country in which wefail to identify short run causality is France. However, in the long run we were able to uncovercausality in all countries. In four countries, namely Canada, Italy, Japan and UK, there is evidenceof a bi-directional causality, suggesting that these countries may beneﬁt from integrating energyand economic policies in the long run. In France and the US, the long run causality is reversedand running from energy consumption to income. This may be suggesting that the long runeconomic growth in these countries may be heavily relying on energy use but not vice versa.Only in Germany we were able to ﬁnd uni-directional causality running from income to energyconsumption. Note that by introducing investment and labor we uncover causality between incomeand energy consumption that went unnoticed in the bivariate analyses of Soytas and Sari (2003)\\nfor some countries. Hence, our results may be pointing out that empirical pursuits investigating therelationship between energy use and economic growth may beneﬁt from the guidance of economictheory in reducing the omitted variables bias that may be affecting the Granger causality tests.\\nAs a ﬁnal analysis, we employ, generalized forecast error variance decompositions approach\\ndiscussed in Koop et al. (1996) andPesaran and Shin (1998) . The unique feature of this approach\\nis that the results are invariant to the ordering of the variables entering to V AR system.\\n6The gen-\\neralized variance decompositions (GVD) can be viewed as out of sample causality tests. To gaugethe relative strength and dynamic interaction of the variables, we ﬁrst shock the system and thendecompose forecast error variances. The decomposed variances allow researchers to assess the rel-ative importance of an individual variable due to its own shocks and the shocks of other variables.\\nThe results of GVD are reported in Table 2 . To conserve space, we report only the results for\\nper capita GDP and energy equations, since our focus is on these two variables, and only the ﬁrst\\nand the ﬁfth horizons, since the results seem to stabilize after 5 years.\\nThe ﬁndings based on income equations show that the impact of energy consumption on\\nper capita GDP initially ranges from 0.005% to approximately 65%. In France energy explains\\n0.005% of variation in per capita GDP, the lowest, while in Italy the initial impact of energy on\\n6In the literature, there are two basic approaches that decompose forecast error variances; standard orthogonalized\\nmethod and generalized technique. The standard approach is developed by Sims (1980) which is based on Cholesky\\ndecomposition and orthogonalized shocks. The “orthogonality” feature of this approach is criticized in Lutkepohl (1991) ,\\nsince the results are sensitive to the order in which the variables are entered into the V AR. In the standard orthogonalized\\nmethod, at least one variable has no contemporaneous effect on another and that variable depends on the ordering of thevariables. The results of this method, therefore, are subject to serious shortcomings. To overcome the shortcomings, weuse the generalized forecast error variance decompositions approach.746 U. Soytas, R.

In Germany, Japan and UK, the\\nimpact of energy consumption on income is similar in magnitudes both in the short and the longruns. The impact is approximately 35% on average in these countries. In US, Canada and France,there is a considerable difference between initial impact of an innovation in energy on incomeand the impact by the 10th horizon. The results for US shows that initially energy explains morethan 47% of variation in income and more than 33% in the 10th horizon, which is lower than theU. Soytas, R.

The results also reveal that income explains a considerable portion ofvolatility in energy consumption in all countries. Only in France and Canada the impact of incomeon energy consumption is less than 20%. In all other countries the impact is more than 30% inalmost all horizons. In Japan, UK and Germany the impact of income on energy is greater thanthe impact of energy on income.\\nWhen assessing the relative strength of all inputs in the income equations, although the results\\nappear to be mixed, in most cases the impact of energy on income is higher than the impactof employment. This is true for Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan and UK. In Italy, the impactof energy consumption is relatively higher than other variables in all horizons. In US, in theshort run energy consumption explains more variation in income than labor, though in the longerhorizons (after the 5th year) the impact of energy is higher than any other inputs. Similar resultswere reported in Sari and Soytas (2004) for Turkey and Beaudreau (2005) for US, Germany and\\nJapan.\\n6. Conclusions and policy implications\\nThis paper investigated the relationship between energy consumption and income in a pro-\\nduction function framework utilizing annual data from G-7 countries. We uncovered long runcausality between energy use and income in all G-7 countries. In four countries (Canada, Italy,Japan and UK) causality seems to run both ways, in two of them (US and France) from energyuse to income, and only in one (Germany) from income to energy consumption. Therefore,Germany may contribute to the ﬁght against global warming directly implementing energy con-servation measures, whereas, US and France may focus on technological developments andmitigation policies. For Canada, Italy, Japan and UK a balanced combination of alternativepolicies seems to be appropriate. In the short run, energy conservation may signiﬁcantly con-tribute to ﬁght against global warming without hindering economic growth in Germany, Italy andJapan, since the causal relationship is from income to energy in these countries. It seems thatUS and Canada should implement energy policies that are similar both in the short and the longruns.\\nThe GVD results along with the causality test results suggest that energy should be considered\\nas a major factor that inﬂuences economic growth. According to our results, in the long runespecially the US and the French economies may feel the negative impact of reduced energyconsumption on growth. However, for Canada, Italy, Japan and UK energy use seems to bestrongly endogenous as well. The only country that may not be affected negatively from energyconservation seems to be Germany.\\nNevertheless, environmental policies aimed at decreasing energy intensity, increasing energy\\nefﬁciency, increasing utilization of public transportation and establishing a price mechanism thatmay encourage the use of renewable and environmental friendly energy sources, developing amarket for emissions trading, investing in technology that makes alternative energy sources morefeasible may mitigate the pressure on the environment, although the potential of renewable andenvironmental friendly energy sources to fully replace the fossil fuels in the foreseeable futuremay be rather bleak.\\nAs for policies considering the growth of economic output, our results imply that forecasts of\\neconomic growth would improve when energy use is incorporated in the forecasting equations.Policy makers should be cautious in designing energy conservation policies so as not to interferewith the economic growth goals ( Lee, 2005 ), and should pursue sustainable energy supply in748 U. Soytas, R. Sari / Journal of Policy Modeling 28 (2006) 739–750\\ndeveloping economic growth strategies. Another implication of the close link between energy\\nuse and economic growth in the long run may be that to achieve sustainable growth countriesmay need to rely more on renewable energy sources to ensure uninterrupted supply as traditionalenergy sources become scarcer.\\nReferences\\nAbosedra, S., & Baghestani, H.

Most of this energy is for the provision of lighting, heating, cooling, and airconditioning. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of CO\\n2and NO xemissions and\\nCFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies.\\nUnder the 1997 Montreal Protocol, governments agreed to phase out chemicals used as refrigerantsthat have the potential to destroy stratospheric ozone. It was therefore considered desirable to reduceenergy consumption and decrease the rate of depletion of world energy reserves and pollution of the\\nenvironment. One way of reducing building energy consumption is to design building, which are\\nmore economical in their use of energy for heating, lighting, cooling, ventilation and hot watersupply. Passive measures, particularly natural or hybrid ventilation rather than air-conditioning, can\\ndramatically reduce primary energy consumption. However, exploitation of renewable energy in\\nbuildings and agricultural greenhouses can, also, signiﬁcantly contribute towards reducingdependency on fossil fuels. Therefore, promoting innovative renewable applications and reinforcing\\nthe renewable energy market will contribute to preservation of the ecosystem by reducing emissions\\nat local and global levels. This will also contribute to the amelioration of environmental conditionsby replacing conventional fuels with renewable energies that produce no air pollution or greenhouse\\ngases. The provision of good indoor environmental quality while achieving energy and cost-efﬁcient\\noperation of the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) plants in buildings represents amulti-variant problem. The comfort of building occupants is dependent on many environmentalparameters including air speed, temperature, relative humidity and quality in addition to lighting and\\nnoise. The overall objective is to provide a high level of building performance (BP), which can be\\ndeﬁned as indoor environmental quality (IEQ), energy efﬁciency (EE) and cost efﬁciency (CE).\\n/C15Indoor environmental quality is the perceived condition of comfort that building occupants\\nexperience due to the physical and psychological conditions to which they are exposed by theirARTICLE IN PRESS\\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/rser\\n1364-0321/$ - see front matter r2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The main physical parameters affecting IEQ are air speed, temperature, relative\\nhumidity and quality.\\n/C15Energy efﬁciency is related to the provision of the desired environmental conditions while\\nconsuming the minimal quantity of energy.\\n/C15Cost efﬁciency is the ﬁnancial expenditure on energy relative to the level of environmental comfortand productivity that the building occupants attained.

Introduction\\nSeveral deﬁnitions of sustainable development have been put forth, including the\\nfollowing common one: development that meets the needs of the present withoutcompromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. A recent WorldEnergy Council (WEC) study found that without any change in our current practice, theworld energy demand in 2020 would be 50–80% higher than 1990 levels. According to aARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2266recent USA Department of Energy (DoE) report, annual energy demand will increase from\\na current capacity of 363 million kilowatts to 750 million kilowatts by 2020. The world’senergy consumption today is estimated to 22 billion kWh yr\\n/C01, 53 billion kWh by 2020.\\nSuch ever-increasing demand could place signiﬁcant strain on the current energy\\ninfrastructure and potentially damage world environmental health by CO, CO 2,S O 2,\\nNO xefﬂuent gas emissions and global warming. Achieving solutions to environmental\\nproblems that we face today requires long-term potential actions for sustainabledevelopment. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of themost efﬁcient and effective solutions since the intimate relationship between renewableenergy and sustainable development. More rational use of energy is an important bridge tohelp transition from today’s fossil fuel dominated world to a world powered by non-polluting fuels and advanced technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cells (FC) [1].\\nAn approach is needed to integrate renewable energies in a way to meet high building\\nperformance. However, because renewable energy sources are stochastic and geographi-cally diffuse, their ability to match demand is determined by adoption of one of thefollowing two approaches [2]: the utilisation of a capture area greater than that occupied\\nby the community to be supplied, or the reduction of the community’s energy demands toa level commensurate with the locally available renewable resources.\\nFor a northern European climate, which is characterised by an average annual solar\\nirradiance of 150 W m\\n/C02, the mean power production from a photovoltaic component of\\n13% conversion efﬁciency is approximately 20 W m/C02. For an average wind speed of\\n5ms/C01, the power produced by a micro wind turbine will be of a similar order of\\nmagnitude, though with a different proﬁle shape. In the UK, for example, a typical ofﬁcebuilding will have a demand in the order of 300 kWh m\\n/C02yr/C01. This translates into\\napproximately 50 W m/C02of fac -ade, which is twice as much as the available renewable\\nenergies [3]. Thus, the aim is to utilise energy efﬁciency measures in order to reduce the\\noverall energy consumption and adjust the demand proﬁles to be met by renewableenergies. For instance, this approach can be applied to greenhouses, which use solar energy\\nto provide indoor environmental quality. The greenhouse effect is one result of the\\ndiffering properties of heat radiation when it is generated at different temperatures.Objects inside the greenhouse, or any other building, such as plants, re-radiate the heat orabsorb it. Because the objects inside the greenhouse are at a lower temperature than thesun, the re-radiated heat is of longer wavelengths, and cannot penetrate the glass. This re-radiated heat is trapped and causes the temperature inside the greenhouse to rise. Note thatthe atmosphere surrounding the earth, also, behaves as a large greenhouse around theworld. Changes to the gases in the atmosphere, such as increased carbon dioxide content\\nfrom the burning of fossil fuels, can act like a layer of glass and reduce the quantity of heat\\nthat the planet earth would otherwise radiate back into space. This particular greenhouseeffect, therefore, contributes to global warming. The application of greenhouses for plantsgrowth can be considered one of the measures in the success of solving this problem.Maximising the efﬁciency gained from a greenhouse can be achieved using variousapproaches, employing different techniques that could be applied at the design,construction and operational stages. The development of greenhouses could be a solutionto farming industry and food security.\\nEnergy security, economic growth and environment protection are the national energy\\npolicy drivers of any country of the world. As world populations grow, many faster thanthe average 2%, the need for more and more energy is exacerbated ( Fig. 1 ). EnhancedARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2267lifestyle and energy demand rise together and the wealthy industrialised economics, which\\ncontain 25% of the world’s population, consume 75% of the world’s energy supply. The\\nworld’s energy consumption today is estimated to 22 billion kWh yr/C01. About 6.6 billion\\nmetric tons carbon equivalent of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission are released in theatmosphere to meet this energy demand [4]. Approximately, 80% is due to carbon\\nemissions from the combustion of energy fuels. At the current rate of usage, taking intoconsideration population increases and higher consumption of energy by developingcountries, oil resources, natural gas and uranium will be depleted within a few decades. Asfor coal, it may take two centuries or so.\\nTechnological progress has dramatically changed the world in a variety of ways. It has,\\nhowever, also led to developments, e.g., environmental problems, which threaten man andnature. Build-up of carbon dioxide and other GHGs is leading to global warming withunpredictable but potentially catastrophic consequences. When fossil fuels burn, they emittoxic pollutants that damage the environment and people’s health with over 700,000 deathsresulting each year, according to the World Bank review of 2000. At the current rate ofusage, taking into consideration population increases and higher consumption of energyby developing countries, oil resources, natural gas and uranium will be depleted within a\\nfew decades, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 . As for coal, it may take two centuries or so. One\\nmust therefore endeavour to take precautions today for a viable world for cominggenerations.\\nResearch into future alternatives has been and still being conducted aiming to solve the\\ncomplex problems of this recent time, e.g., rising energy requirements of a rapidly andconstantly growing world population and global environmental pollution. Therefore,options for a long-term and environmentally friendly energy supply have to be developedleading to the use of renewable sources (water, sun, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydrogen)\\nand fuel cells. Renewables could shield a nation from the negative effect in the energy\\nsupply, price and related environment concerns. Hydrogen for fuel cells and the sun for PVhave been considered for many years as a likely and eventual substitute for oil, gas, coaland uranium. They are the most abundant elements in the universe.

A 1-kW PV system producing 150 kWh each month prevents 75 kg of fossilfuel from being mined. It avoids 150 kg of CO\\n2from entering the atmosphere and keeps\\n473 l of water from being consumed. Electricity from fuel cells can be used in the same wayas grid power: to run appliances and light bulbs and even to power cars since each gallon ofgasoline produced and used in an internal combustion engine releases roughly 12 kg ofCO\\n2, a GHS that contributes to global warming.\\n2.

The past few decades, however, have experienced many\\nvaluable uses for these complex chemical substances, manufacturing from them plastics,textiles, fertiliser and the various end products of the petrochemical industry. Indeed, eachdecade sees increasing uses for these products. Renewable energy is the term used to\\ndescribe a wide range of naturally occurring, replenishing energy sources. Coal, oil and\\ngas, which will certainly be of great value to future generations, as they are to ours, arenon-renewable natural resources. The rapid depletion of non-renewable fossil resourcesneed not continue. This is particularly true now as it is, or soon will be, technically andeconomically feasible to supply all of man’s needs from the most abundant energy sourceof all, the sun. The sunlight is not only inexhaustible, but, moreover, it is the only energysource, which is completely non-polluting.\\nIndustry’s use of fossil fuels has been blamed for warming the climate. When coal, gas\\nand oil are burnt, they release harmful gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause\\nglobal warming. However, there has been an ongoing debate on this subject, as scientistshave struggled to distinguish between changes, which are human induced, and those, whichcould be put down to natural climate variability. Nevertheless, industrialised countrieshave the highest emission levels, and must shoulder the greatest responsibility for globalwarming. However, action must also be taken by developing countries to avoid futureincreases in emission levels as their economies develop and populations grows, as clearlycaptured by the Kyoto Protocol [4]. Notably, human activities that emit carbon dioxide\\n(CO\\n2), the most signiﬁcant contributor to potential climate change, occur primarily from\\nfossil fuel production. Consequently, efforts to control CO 2emissions could have serious,\\nnegative consequences for economic growth, employment, investment, trade and thestandard of living of individuals everywhere.\\nScientiﬁcally, it is difﬁcult to predict the relationship between global temperature and\\nGHG concentrations. The climate system contains many processes that will change ifwarming occurs. Critical processes include heat transfer by winds and tides, thehydrological cycle involving evaporation, precipitation, runoff and groundwater and the\\nformation of clouds, snow, and ice, all of which display enormous natural variability.\\nThe equipment and infrastructure for energy supply and use are designed with long\\nlifetimes, and the premature turnover of capital stock involves signiﬁcant costs. Economicbeneﬁts occur if capital stock is replaced with more efﬁcient equipment in step with itsnormal replacement cycle. Likewise, if opportunities to reduce future emissions are takenin a timely manner, they should be less costly. Such a ﬂexible approach would allow societyto take account of evolving scientiﬁc and technological knowledge, while gainingexperience in designing policies to address climate change [4].\\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 committed itself\\nto ‘‘encourage and promote the development of renewable energy sources to accelerate theshift towards sustainable consumption and production’’. Accordingly, it aimed at breakingthe link between resource use and productivity. This can be achieved by the following:\\n/C15Trying to ensure economic growth does not cause environmental pollution.\\n/C15Improving resource efﬁciency.\\n/C15Examining the whole life-cycle of a product.\\n/C15Enabling consumers to receive more information on products and services.\\n/C15Examining how taxes, voluntary agreements, subsidies, regulation and informationcampaigns, can best stimulate innovation and investment to provide cleaner technology.ARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2270The energy conservation scenarios include rational use of energy policies in all economy\\nsectors and the use of combined heat and power systems, which are able to add to energysavings from the autonomous power plants. Electricity from renewable energy sources isby deﬁnition the environmental green product. Hence, a renewable energy certiﬁcate\\nsystem, as recommended by the World Summit, is an essential basis for all policy systems,\\nindependent of the renewable energy support scheme. It is, therefore, important that allparties involved support the renewable energy certiﬁcate system in place if it is to work asplanned. Moreover, existing renewable energy technologies (RETs) could play a signiﬁcantmitigating role, but the economic and political climate will have to change ﬁrst. Climatechange is real. It is happening now, and GHGs produced by human activities aresigniﬁcantly contributing to it. The predicted global temperature increase of between 1.5and 4.5 1C could lead to potentially catastrophic environmental impacts [5]. These include\\nsea level rise, increased frequency of extreme weather events, ﬂoods, droughts, disease\\nmigration from various places and possible stalling of the Gulf Stream. This has ledscientists to argue that climate change issues are not ones that politicians can afford toignore, and policy makers tend to agree [5]. However, reaching international agreements\\non climate change policies is no trivial task as the difﬁculty in ratifying the Kyoto Protocolhas proved.\\nTherefore, the use of renewable energy sources and the rational use of energy, in general,\\nare the fundamental inputs for any responsible energy policy. However, the energy\\nsector is encountering difﬁculties because increased production and consumption\\nlevels entail higher levels of pollution and eventually climate change, with possiblydisastrous consequences. At the same time, it is important to secure energy at anacceptable cost in order to avoid negative impacts on economic growth. To date,renewable energy contributes as much as 20% of the global energy supplies world-wide [5]. Over two-thirds of this come from biomass use, mostly in developing\\ncountries, some of it unsustainable. Yet, the potential for energy from sustainabletechnologies is huge. On the technological side, renewables have an obvious role to\\nplay. In general, there is no problem in terms of the technical potential of renewables to\\ndeliver energy. Moreover, there are very good opportunities for RETs to play animportant role in reducing emissions of GHGs into the atmosphere, certainly farmore than have been exploited so far. However, there are still some technicalissues to address in order to cope with the intermittency of some renewables, parti-cularly wind and solar. Yet, the biggest problem with relying on renewables todeliver the necessary cuts in GHG emissions is more to do with politics and policyissues than with technical ones [5]. For example, the single most important step\\ngovernments could take to promote and increase the use of renewables is to improve access\\nfor renewables to the energy market. This access to the market needs to be underfavourable conditions and, possibly, under favourable economic rates as well. One movethat could help, or at least justify, better market access would be to acknowledge that thereare environmental costs associated with other energy supply options and that these costsare not currently internalised within the market price of electricity or fuels. This couldmake a signiﬁcant difference, particularly if appropriate subsidies were applied torenewable energy in recognition of the environmental beneﬁts it offers. Similarly, cutting\\nenergy consumption through end-use efﬁciency is absolutely essential. This suggests that\\nissues of end-use consumption of energy will have to come into the discussion in theforeseeable future [6].ARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2271However, RETs have the beneﬁt of being environmentally benign when developed in a\\nsensitive and appropriate way with the full involvement of local communities. In addition,they are diverse, secure, locally based and abundant. In spite of the enormous potentialand the multiple beneﬁts, the contribution from renewable energy still lags behind the\\nambitious claims for it due to the initially high development costs, concerns about local\\nimpacts, lack of research funding and poor institutional and economic arrangements [7].\\nHence, an approach is needed to integrate renewable energies in a way that meets high\\nbuilding performance requirements. However, because renewable energy sources arestochastic and geographically diffuse, their ability to match demand is determined byadoption of one of the following two approaches [8]: the utilisation of a capture area\\ngreater than that occupied by the community to be supplied, or the reduction of thecommunity’s energy demands to a level commensurate with the locally available renewable\\nresources.\\n2.1. Energy and population growth\\nUrban areas throughout the world have increased in size during recent decades. About\\n50% of the world’s population and approximately 7.6% in more developed countries areurban dwellers [9]. Even though there is evidence to suggest that in many ‘advanced’\\nindustrialised countries there has been a reversal in the rural-to-urban shift of populations,\\nvirtually all population growth expected between 2000 and 2030 will be concentrated in\\nurban areas of the world. With an expected annual growth of 1.8%, the world’s urbanpopulation will double in 38 years [9].\\nWith increasing urbanisation in the world, cities are growing in number, population and\\ncomplexity. At present, 2% of the world’s land surface is covered by cities, yet the peopleliving in them consume 75% of the resources consumed by mankind [10]. Indeed, the\\necological footprint of cities is many times larger than the areas they physically occupy.Economic and social imperatives often dictate that cities must become more concentrated,\\nmaking it necessary to increase the density to accommodate the people, to reduce the cost\\nof public services, and to achieve required social cohesiveness. The reality of modernurbanisation inevitably leads to higher densities than in traditional settlements and thistrend is particularly notable in developing countries.\\nGenerally, the world population is rising rapidly, notably in the developing countries.\\nHistorical trends suggest that increased annual energy use per capita, which promotes adecrease in population growth rate, is a good surrogate for the standard of living factors. Ifthese trends continue, the stabilisation of the world’s population will require the increased\\nuse of all sources of energy, particularly as cheap oil and gas are depleted. The improved\\nefﬁciency of energy use and renewable energy sources will, therefore, be essential instabilising population, while providing a decent standard of living all over the world [10].\\nMoreover, energy is the vital input for economic and social development of any country.With an increase in industrial and agricultural activities, the demand for energy is alsorising. It is, however, a well-accepted fact that commercial energy use has to be minimised.This is because of the environmental effects and the availability problems. Consequently,the focus has now shifted to non-commercial energy resources, which are renewable in\\nnature. This is bound to have less environmental effects and also the availability is\\nguaranteed. However, even though the ideal situation will be to enthuse people to userenewable energy resources, there are many practical difﬁculties, which need to be tackled.ARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2272The people groups who are using the non-commercial energy resources, like urban\\ncommunities, are now becoming more demanding and wish to have commercial energyresources made available for their use. This is attributed to the increased awareness,improved literacy level and changing culture [10]. The quality of life practiced by people is\\nusually represented as being proportional to the per capita energy use of that particular\\ncountry. It is not surprising that people want to improve their quality of life. Consequently,it is expected that the demand for commercial energy resources will increase at a greaterrate in the years to come [10]. Because of this emerging situation, the policy makers are left\\nwith two options: either to concentrate on renewable energy resources and have them assubstitutes for commercial energy resources or to have a dual approach in which renewableenergy resources will contribute to meet a signiﬁcant portion of the demand whereas theconventional commercial energy resources would be used with caution whenever\\nnecessary. Even though the ﬁrst option is the ideal one, the second approach will be\\nmore appropriate for a smooth transition [10].\\n2.2. Energy and environmental problems\\nTechnological progress has dramatically changed the world in a variety of ways. It has,\\nhowever, also led to developments of environmental problems, which threaten man andnature. During the past two decades, the risk and reality of environmental degradationhave become more apparent. Growing evidence of environmental problems is due to acombination of several factors since the environmental impact of human activities hasgrown dramatically because of the sheer increase of world population, consumption,industrial activity, etc. throughout the 1970s most environmental analysis and legal controlinstruments concentrated on conventional efﬂuent gas pollutants such as SO\\n2,N O x,C O 2,\\nparticulates, and CO ( Table 1 ). Recently, environmental concerns have extended to the\\ncontrol of micro or hazardous air pollutants, which are usually toxic chemical substancesand harmful in small doses, as well to that of globally signiﬁcant pollutants such as CO\\n2.ARTICLE IN PRESS\\nTable 1\\nEU criteria pollutant standards in the ambient air environment\\nPollutant EU limitCO 30 mg m\\n/C02;1 h\\nNO 2 200mgm/C02;1 h\\nO3 235mgm/C02;1 h\\nSO2 250–350 mgm/C02;2 4 h\\n80–120 mgm/C02; annual\\nPM 10 250mgm/C02;2 4 h\\n80mgm/C02; annual\\nSO2+PM 10 100–150 mgm/C02;2 4 h\\n40–60mgm/C02; annual\\nPb 2 mgm/C02; annual\\nTotal suspended particulate (TSP) 260 mgm/C02;2 4 h\\nHC 160 mgm/C02;3 hA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2273Aside from advances in environmental science, developments in industrial processes and\\nstructures have led to new environmental problems. For example, in the energy sector,major shifts to the road transport of industrial goods and to individual travel by cars hasled to an increase in road trafﬁc and hence a shift in attention paid to the effects and\\nsources of NO\\nxand volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Environmental problems\\nspan a continuously growing range of pollutants, hazards and ecosystem degradation overwider areas. The main areas of environmental problems are: major environmentalaccidents, water pollution, maritime pollution, land use and sitting impact, radiation andradioactivity, solid waste disposal, hazardous air pollutants, ambient air quality, acid rain,stratospheric ozone depletion and global warming (greenhouse effect, global climaticchange) ( Table 2 ).\\nThe four more important types of harm from man’s activities are global warming gases,\\nozone destroying gases, gaseous pollutants and microbiological hazards ( Table 3 ). The\\nearth is some 30 1C warmer due to the presence of gases but the global temperature is\\nrising. This could lead to the sea level rising at the rate of 60 mm each decade with thegrowing risk of ﬂooding in low-lying areas ( Fig. 4 ). At the United Nations Earth Summit\\nat Rio in June 1992, some 153 countries agreed to pursue sustainable development [11].\\nA main aim was to reduce emission of carbon dioxide and other GHGs. Reduction ofenergy use in buildings is a major role in achieving this. Carbon dioxide targets areproposed to encourage designers to look at low energy designs and energy sources.ARTICLE IN PRESS\\nTable 2\\nSigniﬁcant EU environmental directives in water, air and land environments\\nEnvironment Directive nameWater Surface water for drinking\\nSampling surface water for drinking\\nDrinking water quality\\nQuality of freshwater supporting ﬁshShellﬁsh watersBathing waters\\nDangerous substances in water\\nGroundwaterUrban wastewater\\nNitrates from agricultural sources\\nAir Smokes in air\\nSulphur dioxide in air\\nLead in airLarge combustion plantsExisting municipal incineration plants\\nNew municipal incineration plants\\nAsbestos in airSulphur content of gas oil\\nLead in petrol\\nEmissions from petrol enginesAir quality standards for NO\\n2\\nEmissions from diesel engines\\nLand Protection of soil when sludge is appliedA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2274Problems with energy supply and use are related not only to global warming that is\\ntaking place, due to efﬂuent gas emission mainly CO 2, but also to such environmental\\nconcerns as air pollution, acid precipitation, ozone depletion, forest destruction and\\nemission of radioactive substances. These issues must be taken into considerationsimultaneously if humanity is to achieve a bright energy future with minimalenvironmental impacts. Much evidence exists, which suggests that the future will benegatively impacted if humans keep degrading the environment ( Table 4 ).\\nDuring the past century, global surface temperatures have increased at a rate near\\n0.61C/century and the average temperature of the Atlantic, Paciﬁc and Indian oceans\\n(covering 72% of the earth surface) have risen by 0.06 1C since 1995.

Also, according to the USA\\nDepartment of Energy, world emissions of carbon are expected to increase by 54% above1990 levels by 2015 making the earth likely to warm 1.7–4.9 1C over the period 1990–2100,ARTICLE IN PRESS\\nTable 3\\nThe external environment\\nDamage Manifestation DesignNO\\nx,S O x Irritant Low NO xburners\\nAcid rain land damage Low sulphur fuel\\nAcid rain ﬁsh damage Sulphur removal\\nGlobal warming Thermal insulation\\nCO 2 Rising sea level Heat recovery\\nDrought, storms Heat pumps\\nO3destruction Increased ultra violet No CFC’s or HCFC’s\\nSkin cancer Minimum air conditioningCrop damage Refrigerant collection\\nLegionnellosis Pontiac fever Careful maintenance\\nLegionnaires Dry cooling towers\\n200\\n0100\\n1900 1950 2000 2050Global change\\n(mm) \\nYears\\nFig. 4.

Such observation and others demonstrate that interests will likely\\nincrease regarding energy related environment concerns and that energy is one of the main\\nfactors that must be considered in discussions of sustainable development.\\n2.3. Environmental transformations\\nIn recent years, a number of countries have adopted policies aimed at giving a greater\\nrole to private ownership in the natural resource sector. For example, in the UK, theregional water companies have been privatised and have been given a considerable degreeof control over the exploitation of the nation’s regional water resources. Similar policieshave been followed in France and other European countries. Typically, a whole range of\\nnew regulatory instruments such as technological standards accompanies such privatisa-\\ntion on water treatment plants, minimum standards on drinking water quality, pricecontrols and maximum withdrawal quotas. While some of these instruments addressproblems of monopolistic behaviour and other forms of imperfect competition, the bulk ofregulatory measures are concerned with establishing ‘good practices’ aimed at maintainingthe quality of the newly privatised resources as a shorthand. Society has to meet thefreshwater demands of its population and its industry by extracting water from theregional water resources that are provided by the natural environment (lakes, rivers,\\naquifers, etc.). These water resources are renewable but potentially destructible resources.\\nWhile moderate amounts of human water extractions from a given regional water systemcan be sustained for indeﬁnite periods, excessive extractions will change the geographicalARTICLE IN PRESS\\n012\\n13 7Probability density1990-2030\\n1900-21001.5\\n0.5\\n24 5 68\\nGlobal mean temperature change ( °C)\\nFig. 5.

Typically, recovery from any such resource degradation will be very slowand difﬁcult, if not impossible; resource degradation is partially irreversible [12].\\nTo make sustainable water extraction economically viable, the sustainable policy has to\\nbreak even (all costs are covered by revenues) while unsustainable policy has to beunproﬁtable (costs exceed revenues):\\nð1þrÞvt\\n/C01¼5ytþvt, (1)\\nwhere ris the interest rate, tthe year, yis the revenue,\\nð1þrÞvt/C014105yt, (2)\\nð1þrÞvt/C01o105\\n105/C05/C20/C21\\nvt.

Using g, the equation can be as follows:\\nvt41þr\\n1þgvt/C01. (4)\\nRegulatory measures that prevent resource owners from adopting certain unsustainable\\nextraction policies are a necessary pre-condition for the effective operation of a privatisednatural resource sector. Unregulated water privatisation would result in an inﬂationarydynamics whose distributional effects would threaten the long-term viability of theeconomy. This inﬂationary dynamics is not due to any form of market imperfection but isa natural consequence of the competitive arbitrage behaviour of unregulated privateresource owners.\\n3. Sustainability concept\\nAbsolute sustainability of electricity supply is a simple concept: no depletion of world\\nresources and no ongoing accumulation of residues. Relative sustainability is a usefulconcept in comparing the sustainability of two or more generation technologies. Therefore,\\nonly renewables are absolutely sustainable, and nuclear is more sustainable than fossil.\\nHowever, any discussion about sustainability must not neglect the ability or otherwise ofthe new technologies to support the satisfactory operation of the electricity supplyinfrastructure. The electricity supply system has been developed to have a high degree ofresilience against the loss of transmission circuits and major generators, as well asunusually large and rapid load changes. It is unlikely that consumers would tolerate anyreduction in the quality of the service, even if this were the result of the adoption ofotherwise benign generation technologies. Renewables are generally weather dependent\\nand as such their likely output can be predicted but not controlled. The only control\\npossible is to reduce the output below that available from the resource at any given time.Therefore, to safeguard system stability and security, renewables must be used inARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2277conjunction with other, controllable, generation and with large-scale energy storage. There\\nis a substantial cost associated with this provision.\\nIt is useful to codify all aspects of sustainability, thus ensuring that all factors are taken\\ninto account for each and every development proposal. Therefore, with the intention of\\npromoting debate, the following considerations are proposed:\\n(1) Long-term availability of the energy source or fuel.\\n(2) Price stability of energy source or fuel.\\n(3) Acceptability or otherwise of by-products of the generation process.(4) Grid services, particularly controllability of real and reactive power output.(5) Technological stability, likelihood of rapid technical obsolescence.(6) Knowledge base of applying the technology.(7) Life of the installation—a dam may last more than 100 years, but a gas turbine\\nprobably will not.\\n(8) Maintenance requirement of the plant.\\n3.1. Environmental aspects\\nEnvironmental pollution is a major problem facing all nations of the world. People\\nhave caused air pollution since they learned how to use ﬁre, but man-made airpollution anthropogenic air pollution has rapidly increased since industrialisation began.Many volatile organic compounds and trace metals are emitted into the atmosphere byhuman activities. The pollutants emitted into the atmosphere do not remain con-ﬁned to the area near the source of emission or to the local environment, and canbe transported over long distances, and create regional and global environmental\\nproblems. The privatisation, and price liberalisation in energy ﬁelds has to be secured\\n(but not fully). Availability and adequate energy supplies to the major productivesector is needed. The result is that, the present situation of energy supplies is far betterthan 10 years ago ( Table 5 ).ARTICLE IN PRESS\\nTable 5\\nClassiﬁcations of data requirements\\nPlant data System data\\nExisting data Size Peak load\\nLife Load shape\\nCost (ﬁxed and var.

Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2278A great challenge facing the global community today is to make the industrial\\neconomy more like the biosphere, that is, to make it a more closed system. This wouldsave energy, reduce waste and pollution, and reduce costs. In short, it wouldenhance sustainability. Often, it is technically feasible to recycle waste in one of several\\ndifferent ways. For some wastes, there are powerful arguments for incineration with\\nenergy recovery, rather than material recycling. Cleaner production approach andpollution control measures are needed in the recycling sector as much as in another.The industrial sector world widely is responsible for about one-third of anthro-pogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas. Industry isalso an important emitter of several other greenhouse gases. And many of industry’sproducts emit greenhouse gases as well, either during use or after they become waste.Opportunities exist for substantial reducing industrial emissions through more efﬁcient\\nproduction and use of energy: fuel substitutions, the use of alternative energy technologies,\\nprocess modiﬁcation, and by revising materials strategies to make use of less energyand greenhouse gas intensive materials. Industry has an additional role to play throughthe design of products that use less energy and materials and produce lower greenhousegas emissions.\\nDevelopment in the environmental sense is a rather recent concern relating to the need\\nto manage scarce natural resources in a prudent manner because human welfare ultimatelydepends on ecological services. The environmental interpretation of sustainability focuses\\non the overall viability and health of ecological systems—deﬁned in terms of a\\ncomprehensive, multiscale, dynamic, hierarchical measure of resilience, vigour andorganisation. Natural resource degradation, pollution and loss of biodiversity aredetrimental because they increase vulnerability, undermine system health, and reduceresilience. The environmental issues include:\\n/C15Global and transnational (climate change, ozone layer depletion).\\n/C15Natural habitats (forests and other ecosystems).\\n/C15Land (agricultural zones).\\n/C15Water resources (river basin, aquifer, water shed).\\n/C15Urban-industrial (metropolitan area, air-shed).\\nEnvironmental sustainability depends on several factors, including:\\n/C15Climate change (magnitude and frequency of shocks).\\n/C15Systems vulnerability (extent of impact damage).\\n/C15System resilience (ability to recover from impacts).\\nEconomic importance of environmental issue is increasing, and new technologies\\nare expected to reduce pollution derived both from productive processes andproducts, with costs that are still unknown. This is due to market uncertainty, weakappropriability regime, lack of a dominant design, and difﬁculties in reconﬁguringorganisational routines. The degradation of the global environment is one of the most\\nserious energy issues. Various options are proposed and investigated to mitigate climate\\nchange, acid rain or other environmental problems. Additionally, the following aspectsplay a fundamental role in developing environmental technologies, pointing out howARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M.

This means that the generated series should be long enough to assure theseextremes, and series based on average values from nearby stations.\\nGrowing concerns about social and environmental sustainability have led to increased\\ninterest in planning for the energy utility sector because of its large resource requirements\\nand production of emissions. A number of conﬂicting trends combine to make the energy\\nsector a major concern, even though a clear deﬁnition of how to measure progress towardsustainability is lacking. These trends include imminent competition in the electricityindustry, global climate change, expected long-term growth in population and pressure tobalance living standards (including per capital energy consumption). Designing andimplementing a sustainable energy sector will be a key element of deﬁning and creating asustainable society. In the electricity industry, the question of strategic planning forsustainability seems to conﬂict with the shorter time horizons associated with market\\nforces as deregulation replaces vertical integration. Sustainable low-carbon energy\\nscenarios for the new century emphasise the untapped potential of renewable resources.Rural areas can beneﬁt from this transition. The increased availability of reliable andefﬁcient energy services stimulates new development alternatives. It is concluded thatrenewable environmentally friendly energy must be encouraged, promoted, implemented,and demonstrated by full-scale plant especially for use in remote rural areas.\\nThis is the step in a long journey to encourage a progressive economy, which continues\\nto provide us with high living standards, but at the same time helps reduce pollution, waste\\nmountains, other environmental degradation, and environmental rationale for future\\npolicy-making and intervention to improve market mechanisms.

There is also no scientiﬁc debate over the fact that\\nhuman activity has increased the concentration of the GHGs in the atmosphere (speciallyCO\\n2from combustion of coal, oil and gas). The greenhouse effect is also being ampliﬁed\\nby increased concentrations of other gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide, and CFCs as aresult of human emissions.

The\\nrecent assessment of sustainability is reﬂecting the normative and strategic dimension ofsustainability.\\nSpecial attention is devoted to the most recent development of the concept of\\nsustainability science. A new ﬁeld of sustainability science emerging that seeks to\\nunderstand the fundamental character of interactions between nature and society.Such an understanding must encompass the interaction of global processes with theecological and so characteristics of particular places and sectors. With a view towardpromoting research necessary to achieve such advances, it was proposed an initial set ofcore questions for sustainability science. The deﬁnition of sustainability concept involvesan important transformation and extension of the ecologically based concept of physicalsustainability to the social and economic context of development. Thus, terms of\\nsustainability cannot exclusively be deﬁned from an environmental point of view or basis\\nof attitudes. Rather, the challenge is to deﬁne operational and consistent terms ofsustainability from an integrated social, ecological, and economic system perspective. Inthis respect, the weak and strong sustainability concepts are discussed. In order tointroduce measuring of sustainability, the attention is devoted to the deﬁnition ofrespective criteria. There have been a number of attempts to deﬁne the criterions for theassessment of the sustainability of the market products. Having those criterions as bases, itwas introduced as a speciﬁc application in the energy system design. Measuring\\nsustainability is a major issue as well as a driving force of the discussion on sustainability\\ndevelopment. Special attention in this review is devoted to the potential sustainabledevelopment options. In this respect, a following options are taken into a consideration:prevention of the energy resource depletion with scarcity index control; efﬁciencyassessment; new and renewable energy sources; water pollution mitigation, waterdesalination technologies environment capacity for combustion products; mitigation ofnuclear treat to the environment.\\n4.1.

Effects of urban density\\nCompact development patterns can reduce infrastructure demands and the need to\\ntravel by car. As population density increases, transportation options multiply anddependence areas, per capita fuel consumption is much lower in densely populated areasbecause people drive so much less. Few roads and commercially viable public transport arethe major merits. On the other hand, urban density is a major factor that determines theurban ventilation conditions, as well as the urban temperature. Under given circumstances,an urban area with a high density of buildings can experience poor ventilation and strongheat island effect. In warm-humid regions, these features would lead to a high level of\\nthermal stress of the inhabitants and increased use of energy in air-conditioned buildings.\\nHowever, it is also possible that a high-density urban area, obtained by a mixture of high\\nand low buildings, could have better ventilation conditions than an area with lower densitybut with buildings of the same height. Closely spaced or high-rise buildings are alsoaffected by the use of natural lighting, natural ventilation and solar energy. If not properlyplanned, energy for electric lighting and mechanical cooling/ventilation may be increasedand application of solar energy systems will be greatly limited. Table 13 gives a summary\\nof the positive and negative effects of urban density. All in all, denser city models require\\nmore careful design in order to maximise energy efﬁciency and satisfy other social and\\ndevelopment requirements.

Hence, building energy study provides opportunities not only for identifying\\nenergy and cost savings, but also for examining the indoor and outdoor environment.\\n6.1. Energy efﬁciency and architectural expression\\nThe focus of the world’s attention on environmental issues in recent years has stimulated\\nresponse in many countries, which have led to a closer examination of energy conservation\\nstrategies for conventional fossil fuels. Buildings are important consumers of energy and\\nthus important contributors to emissions of greenhouse gases into the global atmosphere.The development and adoption of suitable renewable energy technology in buildings hasan important role to play. A review of options indicates beneﬁts and some problems [14].\\nThere are two key elements to the fulﬁlling of renewable energy technology potentialwithin the ﬁeld of building design: ﬁrst the installation of appropriate skills and attitudes inbuilding design professionals and second the provision of the opportunity for such peopleto demonstrate their skills. This second element may only be created when the population\\nat large and clients commissioning building design in particular, become more aware of\\nwhat can be achieved and what resources are required. Terms like passive cooling orpassive solar use mean that the cooling of a building or the exploitation of the energy of theARTICLE IN PRESS\\nTable 13\\nEffects of urban density on city’s energy demand\\nPositive effects Negative effectsTransport Transport\\nPromote public transport and reduce the need for,\\nand length of, trips by private carsCongestion in urban areas reduces fuel efﬁciency of\\nvehicles\\nInfrastructure Vertical transportation\\nReduce street length needed to accommodate a givennumber of inhabitantsHigh-rise buildings involve lifts, thus, increasing the\\nneed for electricity for the vertical transportation\\nShorten the length of infrastructure facilities such as\\nwater supply and sewage lines, reducing the energy\\nneeded for pumping\\nThermal performance Urban heat island\\nMulti-story, multiunit buildings could reduce theoverall area of the building’s envelope and heat loss\\nfrom the buildingsHeat released and trapped in the urban areas may\\nincrease the need for air conditioning\\nShading among buildings could reduce solar exposure\\nof buildings during the summer periodThe potential for natural lighting is generally reduced\\nin high-density areas, increasing the need for electric\\nlighting and the load on air conditioning to remove\\nthe heat resulting from the electric lighting\\nEnergy systems Use of solar energy\\nDistrict cooling and heating system, which is usuallymore energy efﬁciency, is more feasible as density is\\nhigherRoof and exposed areas for collection of solar energy\\nare limited\\nVentilation Ventilation\\nA desirable ﬂow pattern around buildings may beobtained by proper arrangement of high-rise buildingblocksA concentration of high rise and large buildings may\\nimpede the urban ventilation conditionsA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2290sun is achieved not by machines but by the building’s particular morphological\\norganisation. Hence, the passive approach to themes of energy savings is essentially basedon the morphological articulations of the constructions. Passive solar design, in particular,can realise signiﬁcant energy and cost savings. For a design to be successful, it is crucial for\\nthe designer to have a good understanding of the use of the building. Few of the buildings\\nhad performed as expected by their designers. To be more precise, their performance hadbeen compromised by a variety of inﬂuences related to their design, construction andoperation. However, there is no doubt that the passive energy approach is certainly the onethat, being supported by the material shape of the buildings has a direct inﬂuence onarchitectural language and most greatly inﬂuences architectural expressiveness [15].\\nFurthermore, form is a main tool in architectural expression. To give form to the materialthings that one produces is an ineluctable necessity. In architecture, form, in fact,\\nsummarises and gives concreteness to its every value in terms of economy, aesthetics,\\nfunctionality and, consequently, energy efﬁciency [16]. The target is to enrich the\\nexpressive message with forms producing an advantage energywise. Hence, form, in itsgeometric and material sense, conditions the energy efﬁciency of a building in itsinteraction with the environment. It is, then, very hard to extract and separate theparameters and the elements relative to this efﬁciency from the expressive unit to whichthey belong. By analysing energy issues and strategies by means of the designs, of whichthey are an integral part, one will, more easily, focus the attention on the relationship\\nbetween these themes, their speciﬁc context and their architectural expressiveness. Many\\nconcrete examples and a whole literature have recently grown up around these subjects andthe wisdom of forms and expedients that belong to millennia-old traditions has beenrediscovered. Such a revisiting, however, is only, or most especially, conceptual, since itmust be ﬁltered through today’s technology and needs; both being almost irreconcilablewith those of the past. Two among the historical concepts are of special importance. One isrooted in the effort to establish rational and friendly strategic relations with the physicalenvironment, while the other recognises the interactions between the psyche and physical\\nperceptions in the creation of the feeling of comfort. The former, which may be deﬁned as\\nan alliance with the environment deals with the physical parameters involving a mixture ofnatural and artiﬁcial ingredients such as soil and vegetation, urban fabrics and pollution[17]. The most dominant outside parameter is, of course, the sun’s irradiation, our planet’s\\nprimary energy source. All these elements can be measured in physical terms and aretherefore the subject of science. Within the second concept, however, one considersthe emotional and intellectual energies, which are the prime inexhaustible source ofrenewable power [18]. In this case, cultural parameters, which are not exactly measurable,\\nare involved. However, they represent the very essence of the architectural quality.\\nObjective scientiﬁc measurement parameters tell us very little about the emotional way ofperceiving, which inﬂuences the messages of human are physical sensorial organs. Theperceptual reality arises from a multitude of sensorial components; visual, thermal,acoustic, olfactory and kinaesthetics. It can, also, arise from the organisational quality ofthe space in which different parameters come together, like the sense of order or ofserenity. Likewise, practical evaluations, such as usefulness, can be involved too. Theevaluation is a wholly subjective matter, but can be shared by a set of experiencing persons\\n[19]. Therefore, these cultural parameters could be different in different contexts in spite of\\nthe inexorable levelling on a planetwide scale. However, the parameters change in theanthropological sense, not only with the cultural environment, but also in relation toARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2291function. The scientiﬁcally measurable parameters can, thus, have their meanings very\\nprofoundly altered by the non-measurable, but describable, cultural parameters.\\nHowever, the low energy target also means to eliminate any excess in the quantities of\\nmaterial and in the manufacturing process necessary for the construction of our built\\nenvironment. This claims for a more sober, elegant and essential expression, which is not\\njeopardising at all, but instead enhancing, the richness and preciousness of architecture,while contributing to a better environment from an aesthetic viewpoint [20]. Arguably, the\\nmost successful designs were in fact the simplest. Paying attention to orientation, plan andform can have far greater impact on energy performance than opting for elaboratesolutions [21]. However, a design strategy can fail when those responsible for specifying\\nmaterials for example, do not implement the passive solar strategy correctly. Similarly,cost-cutting exercises can seriously upset the effectiveness of a design strategy. Therefore, it\\nis imperative that a designer fully informs key personnel, such as the quantity surveyor and\\nclient, about their design and be prepared to defend it. Therefore, the designer should havean adequate understanding of how the occupants or processes, such as ventilation, wouldfunction within the building. Thinking through such processes in isolation withoutreference to others can lead to conﬂicting strategies, which can have a detrimental impactupon performance. Likewise, if the design intent of the building is not communicated to itsoccupants, there is a risk that they will use it inappropriately, thus, compromising itsperformance. Hence, the designer should communicate in simple terms the actions\\nexpected of the occupant to control the building. For example, occupants should be well\\ninformed about how to guard against summer overheating. If the designer opted for asimple, seasonally adjusted control; say, insulated sliding doors were to be used betweenthe mass wall and the internal space. The lesson here is that designers must be prepared todefend their design such that others appreciate the importance and interrelationship ofeach component. A strategy will only work if each individual component is considered aspart of the bigger picture. Failure to implement a component or incorrect installation, forexample, can lead to failure of the strategy and consequently, in some instances, the\\nbuilding may not liked by its occupants due to its poor performance.\\n6.2. Energy efﬁciency\\nEnergy efﬁciency is the most cost-effective way of cutting carbon dioxide emissions and\\nimprovements to households and businesses. It can also have many other additional social,economic and health beneﬁts, such as warmer and healthier homes, lower fuel bills andcompany running costs and, indirectly, jobs. Britain wastes 20% of its fossil fuel and\\nelectricity use. This implies that it would be cost-effective to cut £10 billion a year off the\\ncollective fuel bill and reduce CO\\n2emissions by some 120 million tones. Yet, due to lack of\\ngood information and advice on energy saving, along with the capital to ﬁnance energyefﬁciency improvements, this huge potential for reducing energy demand is not beingrealised. Traditionally, energy utilities have been essentially fuel providers and the industryhas pursued proﬁts from increased volume of sales. Institutional and market arrangementshave favoured energy consumption rather than conservation. However, energy is at thecentre of the sustainable development paradigm as few activities affect the environment as\\nmuch as the continually increasing use of energy. Most of the used energy depends on ﬁnite\\nresources, such as coal, oil, gas and uranium. In addition, more than three-quarters of theworld’s consumption of these fuels is used, often inefﬁciently, by only one-quarter of theARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2292world’s population. Without even addressing these inequities or the precious, ﬁnite nature\\nof these resources, the scale of environmental damage will force the reduction of the usageof these fuels long before they run out.\\nThroughout the energy generation process, there are impacts on the environment on\\nlocal, national and international levels, from opencast mining and oil exploration to\\nemissions of the potent greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in ever increasing concentration.Recently, the world’s leading climate scientists reached an agreement that human activities,such as burning fossil fuels for energy and transport, are causing the world’s temperatureto rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that ‘‘the balanceof evidence suggests a discernible human inﬂuence on global climate’’. It predicts a rate ofwarming greater than any one seen in the last 10,000 years, in other words, throughouthuman history. The exact impact of climate change is difﬁcult to predict and will vary\\nregionally. It could, however, include sea level rise, disrupted agriculture and food supplies\\nand the possibility of more freak weather events such as hurricanes and droughts. Indeed,people already are waking up to the ﬁnancial and social, as well as the environmental, risksof unsustainable energy generation methods that represent the costs of the impacts ofclimate change, acid rain and oil spills. The insurance industry, for example, concernedabout the billion dollar costs of hurricanes and ﬂoods, has joined sides withenvironmentalists to lobby for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. ‘‘Friends of the earth’’is campaigning for a more sustainable energy policy, guided by the principle of\\nenvironmental protection and with the objectives of sound natural resource management\\nand long-term energy security. The key priorities of such an energy policy must be toreduce fossil fuel use, move away from nuclear power, improve the efﬁciency with whichenergy is used and increase the amount of energy obtainable from sustainable, renewablesources. Efﬁcient energy use has never been more crucial than it is today, particularly withthe prospect of the imminent introduction of the climate change levy (CCL). Establishingan energy use action plan is the essential foundation to the elimination of energy waste. Alogical starting point is to carry out an energy audit that enables the assessment of the\\nenergy use and determine what actions to take. The actions are best categorised by splitting\\nmeasures into the following three general groups:\\n(1)High priority/low cost : These are normally measures, which require minimal investment\\nand can be implemented quickly. The followings are some examples of such measures:\\n/C15Good housekeeping, monitoring energy use and targeting waste-fuel practices.\\n/C15Adjusting controls to match requirements.\\n/C15Improved greenhouse space utilisation.\\n/C15Small capital item time switches, thermostats, etc.\\n/C15Carrying out minor maintenance and repairs.\\n/C15Staff education and training.\\n/C15Ensuring that energy is being purchased through the most suitable tariff or contractarrangements.\\n(2)Medium priority/medium cost : Measures, which, although involve little or no design,\\ninvolve greater expenditure and can take longer to implement. Examples of suchmeasures are listed below:\\n/C15New or replacement controls.\\n/C15Greenhouse component alteration, e.g., insulation, sealing glass joints, etc.\\n/C15Alternative equipment components, e.g., energy efﬁcient lamps in light ﬁttings, etc.ARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2293(3)Long-term/high cost : These measures require detailed study and design. They can be\\nbest represented by the followings:\\n/C15Replacing or upgrading of plant and equipment.\\n/C15Fundamental redesign of systems, e.g., CHP installations.\\nThis process can often be a complex experience and therefore the most cost-effective\\napproach is to employ an energy specialist to help.\\n6.3. Policy recommendations for a sustainable energy future\\nSustainability is regarded as a major consideration for both urban and rural\\ndevelopment. People have been exploiting the natural resources with no consideration tothe effects, both short-term (environmental) and long-term (resources crunch). It is alsofelt that knowledge and technology have not been used effectively in utilising energy\\nresources. Energy is the vital input for economic and social development of any country.\\nIts sustainability is an important factor to be considered. The urban areas depend, to alarge extent, on commercial energy sources. The rural areas use non-commercial sourceslike ﬁrewood and agricultural wastes. With the present day trends for improving thequality of life and sustenance of mankind, environmental issues are considered highlyimportant. In this context, the term energy loss has no signiﬁcant technical meaning.Instead, the exergy loss has to be considered, as destruction of exergy is possible. Hence,exergy loss minimisation will help in sustainability. In the process of developing, there are\\ntwo options to manage energy resources: (1) end use matching/demand side management,\\nwhich focuses on the utilities. The mode of obtaining this is decided based on economicterms. It is, therefore, a quantitative approach. (2) Supply side management, which focuseson the renewable energy resource and methods of utilising it. This is decided based onthermodynamic consideration having the resource-user temperature or exergy destructionas the objective criteria. It is, therefore, a qualitative approach. The two options areexplained schematically in Fig. 10 . The exergy-based energy, developed with supply side\\nperspective is shown in Fig. 11 .\\nThe following policy measures had been identiﬁed:\\n/C15Clear environmental and social objectives for energy market liberalisation, including a\\ncommitment to energy efﬁciency and renewables.\\n/C15Economic, institutional and regulatory frameworks, which encourage the transition tototal energy services.\\n/C15Economic measures to encourage utility investment in energy efﬁciency (e.g., levies onfuel bills).\\n/C15Incentives for demand side management, including grants for low-income households,expert advice and training, standards for appliances and buildings and tax incentives.\\n/C15Research and development funding for renewable energy technologies not yetcommercially viable.\\n/C15Continued institutional support for new renewables (such as standard cost-reﬂectivepayments and obligation on utilities to buy).\\n/C15Ecological tax reform to internalise external environmental and social costs withinenergy prices.\\n/C15Planning for sensitive development and public acceptability for renewable energy.ARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2294Energy resources are needed for societal development. Their sustainable development\\nrequires a supply of energy resources that are sustainably available at a reasonable costand can cause no negative societal impacts. Energy resources such as fossil fuels are ﬁniteand lack sustainability, while renewable energy sources are sustainable over a relatively\\nlonger term. Environmental concerns are also a major factor in sustainable development,\\nas activities, which degrade the environment, are not sustainable. Hence, as much asenvironmental impact is associated with energy, sustainable development requires the useof energy resources, which cause as little environmental impact as possible. One way toreduce the resource depletion associated with cycling is to reduce the losses thataccompany the transfer of exergy to consume resources by increasing the efﬁciency ofexergy transfer between resources, i.e., increasing the fraction of exergy removed from oneresource that is transferred to another [22].\\nAs explained above, exergy efﬁciency may be thought of as a more accurate measure of\\nenergy efﬁciency that accounts for quantity and quality aspects of energy ﬂows. Improvedexergy efﬁciency leads to reduced exergy losses. Most efﬁciency improvements produceARTICLE IN PRESS\\nSolar\\nWindBiomass\\nBiogas Constraints: \\n1. Economics\\n2. Environment \\n3.

First, operating energy input requirements are\\nreduced per unit output, and pollutants generated are correspondingly reduced. Second,\\nconsideration of the entire life cycle for energy resources and technologies suggests thatimproved efﬁciency reduces environmental impact during most stages of the life cycle.Quite often, the main concept of sustainability, which often inspires local and nationalauthorities to incorporate environmental consideration into setting up energy programmeshave different meanings in different contexts though it usually embodies a long-termperspective. Future energy systems will largely be shaped by broad and powerful trendsthat have their roots in basic human needs. Combined with increasing world population,\\nthe need will become more apparent for successful implementation of sustainable\\ndevelopment.\\nHeat has a lower exergy, or quality of energy, compared with work. Therefore, heat\\ncannot be converted into work by 100% efﬁciency. Some examples of the differencebetween energy and exergy are shown in Table 14 .\\nThe terms used in Table 14 have the following meanings:\\nCarnot quality factor ðCQFÞ¼\\n1/C0To\\nTs/C18/C19\\n, (5)\\nExergy ¼energy ðtransferred Þ/C2CQF ; (6)\\nwhere Tois the environment temperature (K) and Tsis the temperature of the stream (K).\\nVarious parameters are essential to achieving sustainable development in a society.\\nSome of them are as follows:\\n/C15public awareness\\n/C15information\\n/C15environmental education and training\\n/C15innovative energy strategies\\n/C15renewable energy sources and cleaner technologies\\n/C15ﬁnancing\\n/C15monitoring and evaluation tools\\nThe development of a renewable energy in a country depends on many factors.

Sustainable energy is a prerequisite for\\ndevelopment. Energy-based living standards in developing countries, however, are clearlybelow standards in developed countries. Low levels of access to affordable andenvironmentally sound energy in both rural and urban low-income areas are therefore apredominant issue in developing countries. In recent years, many programmes fordevelopment aid or technical assistance have been focusing on improving access tosustainable energy, many of them with impressive results.\\nApart from success stories, however, experience also shows that positive appraisals of\\nmany projects evaporate after completion and vanishing of the implementation expert\\nteam. Altogether, the diffusion of sustainable technologies such as energy efﬁciency andrenewable energies for cooking, heating, lighting, electrical appliances and buildinginsulation in developing countries has been slow.\\nEnergy efﬁciency and renewable energy programmes could be more sustainable and\\npilot studies more effective and pulse releasing if the entire policy and implemen-tation process was considered and redesigned from the outset. New ﬁnancing andimplementation processes are needed which allow reallocating ﬁnancial resources and thus\\nenabling countries themselves to achieve a sustainable energy infrastructure. The links\\nbetween the energy policy framework, ﬁnancing and implementation of renewable energyand energy efﬁciency projects have to be strengthened, and capacity building efforts arerequired.\\n7. Conclusions\\nThere is strong scientiﬁc evidence that the average temperature of the earth’s surface is\\nrising. This is a result of the increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other GHGs in\\nthe atmosphere as released by burning fossil fuels. This global warming will eventually leadto substantial changes in the world’s climate, which will, in turn, have a major impact onhuman life and the built environment. Therefore, effort has to be made to reduce fossilenergy use and to promote green energies, particularly in the building sector. Energy usereductions can be achieved by minimising the energy demand, by rational energy use, byrecovering heat and the use of more green energies. This study was a step towardsachieving that goal. The adoption of green or sustainable approaches to the way in which\\nsociety is run is seen as an important strategy in ﬁnding a solution to the energy problem.\\nThe key factors to reducing and controlling CO\\n2, which is the major contributor to global\\nwarming, are the use of alternative approaches to energy generation and the exploration ofARTICLE IN PRESS\\nA.M. Omer / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 12 (2008) 2265–2300 2298how these alternatives are used today and may be used in the future as green energy\\nsources. Even with modest assumptions about the availability of land, comprehensive fuel-wood farming programmes offer signiﬁcant energy, economic and environmental beneﬁts.These beneﬁts would be dispersed in rural areas where they are greatly needed and can\\nserve as linkages for further rural economic development. The nations as a whole would\\nbeneﬁt from savings in foreign exchange, improved energy security, and socio-economicimprovements. With a nine-fold increase in forest-plantation cover, a nation’s resourcebase would be greatly improved. The international community would beneﬁt frompollution reduction, climate mitigation, and the increased trading opportunities that arisefrom new income sources. The non-technical issues, which have recently gained attention,include:\\n(1) Environmental and ecological factors, e.g., carbon sequestration, reforestation and\\nrevegetation.\\n(2) Renewables as a CO\\n2neutral replacement for fossil fuels.\\n(3) Greater recognition of the importance of renewable energy, particularly modern\\nbiomass energy carriers, at the policy and planning levels.\\n(4) Greater recognition of the difﬁculties of gathering good and reliable renewable energy\\ndata, and efforts to improve it.\\n(5) Studies on the detrimental health efforts of biomass energy particularly from\\ntraditional energy users.\\nReferences\\n[1] World Energy Outlook.

During the last two decades (1984–2004) primary energy has grown by 49% and CO\\n2emissions by\\n43%, with an average annual increase of 2% and 1.8%respectively ( Fig. 1 ).\\nCurrent predictions show that this growing trend will\\ncontinue. Energy use by nations with emerging economies(Southeast Asia, Middle East, South America and Africa) will\\ngrow at an average annual rate of 3.2% and will exceed by 2020\\nthat for the developed countries (North America, WesternEurope, Japan, Australia and New Zealand) at an averagegrowing rate of 1.1% ( Fig. 2 ). The case of China is striking,taking only 20 years to double its energy consumption at an\\naverage growing rate of 3.7%.\\nInteresting consequences can be obtained from the analysis\\nof the trend of main world energy indicators [1]between 1973\\nand 2004 ( Table 1 ): (1) the rate of population growth is well\\nbelow the GDP, resulting in a considerable rise of per capita\\npersonal income and global wealth, (2) primary energy\\nconsumption is growing at a higher rate than population,leading to the increase of its per capita value on 15.7% over thelast 30 years, (3) CO\\n2emissions have grown at a lower rate than\\nenergy consumption showing a 5% increase during this period,(4) electrical energy consumption has drastically risen (overtwo and a half times) leading to a percentage increase in ﬁnalenergy consumption (18% in 2004), (5) efﬁciency in exploiting\\nenergy resources, shown as the relation between ﬁnal and\\nprimary energy, has declined by 7% points, especially due tosoaring electrical consumption, and (6) ﬁnal and primaryenergy intensities have dropped because of the higher rate ofgrowth of the GDP over the energy consumption increasingratio, resulting in an overall improvement of the global energyefﬁciency.\\nThese ﬁgures conﬁrm the relationship linking energy\\nconsumption with economic development and populationwww.elsevier.com/locate/enbuild\\nEnergy and Buildings 40 (2008) 394–398\\n* Corresponding author.

Globalisation, improvement of living conditions\\nin emerging regions and the development of communicationnetworks, promote developed nations’ life style and raiseenergy needs to consumption patterns that, without doubt, willexhaust fossil fuels and will produce a serious environmentalimpact. In this sense, current energy and socio-economicsystems are deﬁnitively unsustainable.\\n2. Energy consumption in buildings\\nFinal energy consumption is usually shown split into three\\nmain sectors: industry, transport and ‘other’, including in thelast-named, agriculture, service sector and residential. Thismakes it considerably difﬁcult to gather information aboutbuilding energy consumption. For example, energy consump-tion in buildings other than dwellings constitutes a fraction ofthe services shared within the ‘other’ key sector. Considering its\\noverall signiﬁcance in developed countries (buildings account\\nfor a 20–40% of the total ﬁnal energy consumption), we believeit should be accounted for independently and become the thirdmain sector, broken down, at least, for domestic and non-domestic buildings.Growth in population, enhancement of building services and\\ncomfort levels, together with the rise in time spent insidebuildings, have raised building energy consumption to the\\nlevels of transport and industry ( Table 2 ). Especially signiﬁcant\\nis the reduction of the ratio of industry (nine points) and theexpansion of ‘other’ (six points) due to buildings.\\nThe term ‘‘other sectors’’ is ambiguous and produces great\\nconfusion. Many international, national and regional sources,include different end uses within this concept, which makes anysort of comparison difﬁcult. Looking to the evolution ( Fig. 3 )\\nand importance ( Table 3 ) of building energy consumption, we\\nconclude:\\n(1) In the UK building energy consumption has increased at a\\nrate of 0.5% per annum, which is slightly below theEuropean ﬁgure of 1.5%. In contrast building energyconsumption in Spain is increasing at a rate of 4.2% perannum, well above both the European and the NorthAmerican (1.9%) rate. Reasons can be found in the\\neconomic growth, expansion of the building sector and the\\nspread of building services, especially heating, ventilationand air conditioning (HV AC) systems.\\n(2) In 2004, building consumption in the EU was 37% of ﬁnal\\nenergy, bigger than industry (28%) and transport (32%). Inthe UK, the proportion of energy use in building (39%) isslightly above the European ﬁgure. This is in part due to theshift away from heavy industry towards service sector\\nactivities. In contrast the ﬁgure for Spanish buildings is only\\n23%, 14 points below Europe, and expected to rise stronglyas economic growth lead to convergence with the Europeanaverage.\\nThe service sector, which covers all commercial and public\\nbuildings, includes many types of buildings (schools, restau-rants, hotels, hospitals, museums, etc.) with a wide variety ofuses and energy services (HV AC, domestic hot water (DHW),\\nlighting, refrigeration, food preparation, etc.). Growth both\\neconomical and in population, increases the demand of services(health, education, culture, leisure, etc.) and the energyconsumption. In USA, energy consumption in the servicesector has expanded from 11% to 18% from the 1950s. In the\\nFig. 1. Primary energy consumption, CO 2emissions and world population.\\nReference year 1984.

Pe´rez-Lombard et al. / Energy and Buildings 40 (2008) 394–398 395UK, service energy use in 2004 accounted for around 11% of\\nall ﬁnal energy use, equal to the EU average. By contrast theSpanish ﬁgure was only 8% but it is reporting massive\\nincreases and has been multiplied by 2.5 between 1980 and\\n2000.\\nIn the residential sector, size and location are key factors for\\nenergy consumption. Small ﬂats need less energy as there is lessconditioned and transfer area, and also less occupation. Theamount and type of energy used in dwellings are mainly relatedto weather, architectural design, energy systems and economiclevel of the occupants. By and large, dwellings in developed\\ncountries use more energy than those in emerging economies\\nand it is expected to continue growing due to the installation ofnew appliances (air conditioners, computers, etc.). In USA,dwellings consume 22% of the total ﬁnal energy use, comparedwith 26% in the EU. The UK ﬁgure is 28%, well above theSpanish 15% mainly due to a more severe climate and building\\ntype (predominance of independent houses over blocks).\\nThe EIA, in its International Energy Outlook [2], analyses\\nand forecasts future trends in building energy consumption(Fig. 4 ). Energy use in the built environment will grow by 34%\\nin the next 20 years, at an average rate of 1.5%. In 2030,consumption attributed to dwellings and the non-domesticsectors will be 67% and 33% respectively (approximately).Spread in Southeast Asian, and therefore, the growth of\\nconstruction will boost energy demand on the residential sector.\\nForecasts predict that both developed and non-developedeconomies will be balanced in the use of energy in dwellings by2010. Economic, trading and population growth in emergingeconomies will intensify needs for education, health and otherservices, together with the consequential energy consumption.It is expected that energy consumption in the service sector innon-developed countries will be doubled in the next 25 years,\\nwith an annual average growth rate of 2.8%.\\n3. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)\\nThe proliferation of energy consumption and CO\\n2emissions\\nin the built environment has made energy efﬁciency and savings\\nstrategies a priority objective for energy policies in mostcountries. A clear example is the European Energy Perfor-mance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) [3]. Especially important\\nhas been the intensiﬁcation of energy consumption in HVACsystems, which has now become almost essential in parallel tothe spread in the demand for thermal comfort, considered aluxury not long ago. It is the largest energy end use both in the\\nresidential and non-residential sector, comprising heating,\\nventilation and air conditioning.\\nIts predominance is obvious when it is compared with other\\nend uses. For dwellings ( Table 4 ) it represents about half the\\nenergy consumption more than doubling that for DHW. Fornon-domestic buildings, IDAE [4]estimates HVAC energy\\nconsumption to be around 48%, still lower than the 57% in theUSA, and similar to ﬁgures from other sources [5].

Analysis by sectors, as thoseproduced by the EIA for residential [6]and commercial buildings\\n[7]should be funded by governments, so that a comprehensive\\ndatabase of the building stock (type, area, location, age, etc.) and\\nenergy parameters (consumption, expenditures, fuels, end uses,\\netc.) can be the basis for future planning.\\nBy and large, HVAC consumption in developed countries\\naccounts for half the energy use in buildings and one ﬁfth of thetotal national energy use. Moreover, predictions indicate amassive growth in energy consumption and conditioned area inthe EU [9]during the next 15 years, increasing approximately\\nin 50%.\\n4. Non-domestic buildings\\nIn non-domestic buildings, the type of use and activities\\nmake a huge impact on the quality and quantity of energyservices needed. However, few sources offer data by typologyand there is not consensus on a universal classiﬁcation, whichmakes the analysis extremely difﬁcult. After revising severalsources, some general conclusions may be reached:\\n(1) In the UK energy consumption in this sector has stabilised\\nsomewhat in recent years, with increases in ﬂoor area andincreased servicing levels being offset by increases inefﬁciency. Across the rest of Europe energy consumption inthe commercial sector grows at a higher rate than othersectors due predominantly to the expansion of HVACsystems in new buildings [10]. In the UK new build rates in\\nthe service sector are typically around 2%, whilst in Spain\\nthe average annual rate of growth from 2000 is 6.1%, and\\nforecasts show that this will continue increasing. In 2003,this sector was accounting for 11% of the total energyconsumption compared to USA (18%) and equal to EU(11%). Energy policies have focused on the residential andindustrial sectors and have tended to overlook the servicesector, despite its highest growing rate.(2) Ofﬁce and retail are the most energy intensive typologies\\ntypically accounting for over 50% of the total energyconsumption for non-domestic buildings. Hotels andrestaurants, hospitals and schools follow ( Table 5 ).\\n(3) HVAC is the main end use with a weight close to 50%,\\nlighting follows with 15% and appliances with 10%.Building type is critical in how energy end uses aredistributed ( Fig. 5 ) and in their energy intensity ( Table 6 ).\\nThis makes it essential to develop independent studies bybuilding types.\\n5. Ofﬁce buildings\\nWithin the commercial sector, ofﬁce buildings are, together\\nwith retail, those with the biggest consumption and CO\\n2\\nemissions. In USA ofﬁces account for 17% of total non-domestic\\nTable 5\\nEnergy use in the commercial sector by building type\\nBuilding type USA (%) Spain (%) UK (%)\\nRetail 32 22 22\\nOfﬁces 18 33 17\\nHotels and restaurants 14 30 16Schools 13 4 10Hospitals 9 11 6\\nLeisure 6 – 6\\nOthers 9 – 23\\nYear 2003.

In Spain, they account for a third of thecommercial sector energy consumption and almost 2.7% of totalenergy consumed and in the UK for 17% of energy consumption\\nand 2% of total energy use. Therefore, it is advisable to start the\\ncommercial analysis with ofﬁce buildings. Other reasons,supporting energy surveys for this typology are:\\n(1) The substantial increase of total built area of ofﬁce\\nbuildings due to the economical prosperity with many newbusiness developments in mayor city outskirts [11]. During\\n1990–2000, 9.3 Mm\\n2were built in Spain, with no reliable\\ninformation on the total built area. In USA, per capita area is\\nabout 4 m2, well above the European ﬁgure of 2 m2. In the\\nUK the total ﬂoor area of ofﬁces has increased by around4% between 2000 and 2005 [13].\\n(2) The amount of artiﬁcial lighting required, IT equipment use\\nand air-conditioned area have steadily increased. In Spain,more than 90% of companies use IT equipment andvirtually all-new ofﬁces are conditioned. Even in mild\\nweather as in the UK more than half of new ofﬁces are\\nconditioned.\\n(3) It is a typology quite uniform across the building stock, both\\nin envelope and building services, with three key energyend uses, HVAC, lighting and appliances, adding uptogether to about 85% of the total ( Table 7 ).\\n6. Conclusions\\nEnergy consumption of buildings in developed countries\\ncomprises 20–40% of total energy use and is above industry andtransport ﬁgures in EU and USA. However, available informationis clearly insufﬁcient and not proportional to its importance. It isnot considered as an independent sector and there is a lack ofconsistent data which makes it difﬁcult to understand the\\nunderlying changes that affect energy consumption in this sector.\\nIt is essential to make available comprehensive building energyinformation to allow suitable analysis and efﬁciently plan energypolicies for the future. In that respect, studies developed by theEIA on the energy consumption of residential and commercialbuildings in the USA are a valuable reference.\\nProliferation of energy consumption and CO\\n2emissions\\non the built environment have made energy efﬁciencystrategies a priority for energy policies developing new\\nbuilding regulations and certiﬁcation schemes which nowinclude minimum requirements. With the consolidation ofthe demand for thermal comfort, HVAC systems (and its\\nassociated energy consumption) have become an unavoidable\\nasset, accounting for almost half the energy consumed inbuildings, and around 10–20% of total energy consumptionin developed countries.\\nThe growing trend in building energy consumption will\\ncontinue during the coming years due to the expansion of builtarea and associated energy needs, as long as resource andenvironmental exhaustion or economic recession allows it.\\nPrivate initiative together with government intervention\\nthrough the promotion of energy efﬁciency, new technologiesfor energy production, limiting energy consumption and raisingsocial awareness on the rational use of energy will be essentialto make possible a sustainable energy future.\\nReferences\\n[1] International Energy Agency, Key World Energy Statistics, 2006.\\n[2] Energy Information Administration, International Energy Outlook 2006,\\nU.S. Department of Energy, June 2006.\\n[3] Directive 2002/91/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16\\nDecember 2002 on the energy performance of buildings, 2002.\\n[4] Ministerio de Economı ´a, Estrategia de ahorro y eﬁciencia energe ´tica en\\nEspan ˜a 2004–2012, Noviembre 2003.\\n[5] L.

A society seeking sustainable development ideally must utilize only energy resources\\nwhich cause no environmental impact (e.g. which release no emissions to the environment).\\nHowever, since all energy resources lead to some environmental impact, it is reasonable to\\nsuggest that some (not all) of the concerns regarding the limitations imposed on sustainabledevelopment by environmental emissions and their negative impacts can be in part overcome\\nthrough increased energy e\\x81ciency. Clearly, a strong relation exists between energy e\\x81ciency\\nand environmental impact since, for the same services or products, less resource utilization andpollution is normally associated with increased energy e\\x81ciency. Presented in this paper are (i)\\na comprehensive discussion of the future of energy use and the consequent environmental\\nimpacts in terms of acid precipitation, stratospheric ozone depletion and the greenhouse e/C128ect,(ii) some solutions to current environmental issues in terms of energy conservation and renew-able energy technologies, (iii) some theoretical and practical limitations on increased energy\\ne\\x81ciency, (iv) discussions of the relations between energy and sustainable development, and\\nbetween the environment and sustainable development, and an (v) illustrative example. In thisregard, a number of issues relating to energy, environment and sustainable development are\\nexamined from both current and future perspectives.

Rosen).extracting chemicals, and converting heat into mechanical power, as well as for cooking\\nand heating. During burning, the carbon in wood combines with O 2to form CO 2,\\nwhich is then absorbed by plants and converted back to carbon for use as a fuel again.\\nSince wood was unable to meet the fuel demand, the industrial revolution began with\\nthe use of fossil fuels, e.g. oil, coal and gas. Using such fuels has increased the CO 2\\nconcentration in air leading to the beginning of global warming. Despite several warn-ings in the past about the risks of greenhouse-gas emissions, signiﬁcant actions toreduce environmental pollution were not taken and now many researchers have con-cluded that global warming is occurring. During the past two decades, the public hasbecome more aware and researchers and policy makers have focused on this and relatedissues by considering energy, environment and sustainable development.\\nWorld population is expected to double by the middle of the 21st century [1], and\\neconomic development will almost certainly continue to grow. Global demand forenergy services is expected to increase by as much as an order of magnitude by 2050,while primary energy demands are expected to increase by 1.5–3 times [1]. Simulta-neously, concern will likely increase regarding energy-related environmental concernssuch as acid precipitation, stratospheric ozone depletion and global climate change (thegreenhouse e/C128ect). These observations and others demonstrate that energy is one of themain factors that must be considered in discussions of sustainable development.\\nSeveral deﬁnitions of sustainable development have been put forth, including the\\nfollowing common one: ‘‘development that meets the needs of the present withoutcompromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’’ [2]. Manyfactors contribute to achieving sustainable development. One of the most importantis the requirement for a supply of energy resources that is fully sustainable [3–5].Increased energy e\\x81ciency is also important. The material presented in this paper isintended to apply to both industrialized and developing countries.\\nWhile environmental issues in general have been inﬂuencing developments in the\\nenergy sector for some time, climate change poses an altogether di/C128erent kind of chal-lenge. Problems such as acid precipitation could be dealt with in part by administrativemeasures, such as vehicle exhaust standards or emission limits for power stations,which a/C128ect comparatively small numbers of economic actors. Technical ﬁxes with arelatively limited scope, such as ﬁtting ﬂue gas cleaning equipment or catalytic con-verters, could contain the problem. However, emissions of greenhouse gases are sodispersed that it is not possible to take this local and relatively small approach indealing with climate change. The nature of the problem demands a more compre-\\nhensive energy policy response which inﬂuences the actions of energy consumers and\\nproducers in all countries.\\nIn this paper, environmental issues such as acid precipitation, stratospheric ozone\\ndepletion, and the greenhouse e/C128ect are discussed, particularly as they relate to energy,environment and sustainable development. An illustrative example is presented.\\n2. Environmental issues\\nThe most important forms of global pollution problems are as follows:428 I. Dincer, M.A. Rosen / Applied Energy 64 (1999) 427–440.acid precipitation\\n.stratospheric ozone depletion, and\\n.the greenhouse e/C128ect (climate change).\\n2.1. Acid precipitation\\nAcids produced by the combustion of fossil fuels (e.g. in smelters for non-ferrous\\nores, industrial boilers, and transportation vehicles) can be transported over great\\ndistances through the atmosphere and deposited via precipitation on the earth onecosystems that are exceedingly vulnerable to damage from excessive acidity. Thisacid precipitation was found to be mainly attributable to emissions of SO\\n2and NO x\\n[6]. A schematic representation of the formation, distribution, and impact of acidprecipitation is shown in Fig. 1. These pollutants have caused only local concernsrelated to health in the past. However, as awareness of their contribution to theregional and transboundary problem of acid precipitation has grown, concern isnow also focusing on other substances such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs),chlorides, ozone and trace metals that may participate in the complex set of chemi-cal transformations in the atmosphere resulting in acid precipitation and the for-mation of other regional air pollutants. The well known e/C128ects of acid precipitation\\ninclude: acidiﬁcation of lakes, streams and ground waters, resulting in damage to\\nﬁsh and aquatic life; damage to forests and agricultural crops; and deterioration ofmaterials, e.g., buildings, metal structures and fabrics. Some energy-related activities\\nFig. 1. Processes leading to acid rain (source: Perman et al. [18]).I. Dincer, M.A. Rosen / Applied Energy 64 (1999) 427–440 429are major source of acid precipitation. For example, electric power stations, resi-\\ndential heating and industrial energy use account for 80% of SO 2emissions, with\\ncoal use alone accounting for about 70% of SO 2emissions. Another source of acid\\nprecipitation is sour gas treatment which produces H 2S that then reacts to form SO 2\\nwhen exposed to air. Road transport is an important source of NO xemissions,\\naccounting for 48% of the total emissions in OECD countries [7]. Most of theremaining NO\\nxemissions are due to fossil fuel combustion in stationary sources.\\nAdditionally, VOCs are generated by a variety of sources, and comprise a largenumber of diverse compounds. Countries in which the energy-related activitiesmentioned in the previous paragraph occur widely are likely to be signiﬁcant con-tributors to acid precipitation. The largest contributors in the world are the United\\nStates, countries from the former Soviet Union and China [1].\\n2.2. Stratospheric ozone depletion\\nIt is well known that the ozone present in the stratosphere, roughly between alti-\\ntudes of 12 and 25 km, plays a natural, equilibrium-maintaining role such as absorp-\\ntion of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and absorption of infrared radiation [6]. A globalenvironmental problem is the distortion and regional depletion of the stratospheric\\nozone layer which was shown to be caused by chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs), halons\\n(chlorinated and brominated organic compounds) and N\\n2O emissions. Ozone deple-\\ntion in the stratosphere can lead to increased levels of damaging ultraviolet radiationreaching the ground, causing increased rates of skin cancer, eye damage and otherharm to many biological species. Fig. 2 exhibits a schematic representation of the\\nFig. 2. Schematic representation of ozone-depleting sources (source: Perman et al. [18]).430 I. Dincer, M.A. Rosen / Applied Energy 64 (1999) 427–440sources of natural and anthropogenic ozone depleters. Energy-related activities are\\nonly partially (directly or indirectly) responsible for the emissions which lead tostratospheric ozone depletion. Though such energy activities such as fossil fuel and\\nbiomass combustion account for 65–75% of anthropogenic N\\n2O emissions, CFCs\\n[6], which are used in air conditioning and refrigerating equipment as refrigerants\\nand in foam insulation as blowing agents, play the most important role in ozonedepletion. Though scientiﬁc debate on ozone depletion has occurred for over a dec-ade, only in 1987 was an international landmark protocol signed in Montreal toreduce the production of CFCs and halons. Conclusive scientiﬁc evidence of thedestruction of stratospheric ozone by CFCs and halons has recently been gathered, andcommitments for more drastic reductions in their production were undertaken at the\\n1990 London Conference [8]. Replacement products and technologies without CFCs\\nare gradually coming to the fore and should help allow for a total ban of CFCs ulti-mately. An important consideration in such a CFC ban is the need to distribute fairlythe economic burdens deriving from the ban, particularly with respect to developingcountries, some of which have invested heavily in CFC-related technologies.\\n2.3. Greenhouse e/C128ect (global climate change)\\nPotentially the most important environmental problem relating to energy utiliza-\\ntion is global climate change, also known as the global warming or the greenhouse\\ne/C128ect. Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO\\n2,C H 4, CFCs,\\nhalons, N 2O, ozone and peroxyacetylnitrate in the atmosphere are increasing the\\nmanner in which these gases trap heat radiated from the earth’s surface, therebyraising the surface temperature of the earth. The earth’s surface temperature hasincreased about 0.6\\n\\x0eC over the last century, and, as a consequence, the sea level is\\nestimated to have risen by perhaps 20 cm [9]. Such changes can have wide-ranging\\ne/C128ects on human activities all over the world. Currently it is estimated that CO 2\\ncontributes about 50% to the anthropogenic greenhouse e/C128ect.

[10].I. Dincer, M.A. Rosen / Applied Energy 64 (1999) 427–440 431knowledge of the role of various greenhouse gases is summarized. Humankind is\\ncontributing through many of its economic and other activities to the increase in theatmospheric concentrations of various greenhouse gases. For example, CO\\n2releases\\nfrom fossil fuel combustion, methane emissions from increased human activity,CFCs releases and deforestation all contribute to the greenhouse e/C128ect.\\nEnergy-related activities contribute both directly and indirectly to the generation\\nof CO\\n2and other potent greenhouse gases. CO 2emissions from fossil-fuel combus-\\ntion are estimated to account for half of the radiative balance changes caused bygreenhouse gases. Methane emissions, which partly arise from natural gas leaks andcoal mines, account for a signiﬁcant fraction as well. The U.S. Environmental Pro-tection Agency (EPA) study, aimed at determining policy options for stabilizing\\nclimate change, concluded that, in a rapidly changing world, it is possible to restrain\\nemissions of greenhouse gases considerably through e/C128orts aimed speciﬁcally atchanging patterns of energy production and use (e.g. the implementation of energyconservation measures, increased use of biomass and some fuel switching). With theadoption of such measures, the increase in realized warming — an important indi-cator of global climate change — could be restrained to only 2\\n\\x0eC between 2000 and\\n2100 as compared to 5\\x0eC in the most extreme case. The report emphasized, however,\\nthat if industrialized countries were to embark on a climate stabilizing strategy\\nwithout the involvement of developing countries, global temperatures would rise by\\n3.6\\x0eC by 2100 [11]. Hence, crucial to the success of future emissions abatement\\ne/C128orts will be the participation of all countries-both industrialized and developing.\\nIn recognition of this need for global participation in activities to stem the growth\\nin greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA supported two sets of studies aimed at inves-tigating future emissions levels and potential emissions reduction policies in a rangeof countries. The International Energy Studies Group at the Lawrence BerkeleyLaboratory initiated a study to examine the long-term contribution of energy sour-\\nces to carbon emissions from developing countries: the study was conducted in col-\\nlaboration with local experts at research institutions in 11 developing nations andresulted in the development of case studies for Brazil, India, China, Indonesia,South Korea, Mexico, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela and thesix member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) (Bahrain, Kuwait,Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates). The study countriesinclude some of the developing world’s largest consumers of energy, including bio-mass [12]. The country studies provide evidence to support the EPA’s emphasis on\\nthe growing contribution of developing countries to global emissions of greenhouse\\ngases. Estimates of future data culled from the scenarios suggest that developingcountries are the fastest growing source of CO\\n2emissions and will be the largest\\nsource of total emissions within the next 20 years. According to the scenarios,emissions of CO\\n2from 17 major developing countries will reach 3.6 billion tonnes in\\n2025 compared to 0.9 billion tonnes in 1985. The magnitude of the increase isequivalent to adding twice the amount of carbon emissions generated by the USAtoday to the present developing world total. The long-term scenarios indicate that\\nCO\\n2emissions from the 17 developing countries can be reduced to 2.8 billion tonnes\\nthrough e\\x81ciency improvements and fuel-switching measures. China’s predominant432 I. Dincer, M.A. Rosen / Applied Energy 64 (1999) 427–440contribution to total emissions was highlighted in the report. Emissions of CO 2from\\nChina amount to 480 million tonnes or almost 53% of the total emissions in the\\nstudies countries in 1985. This ﬁgure will increase to 1.7 billion tonnes in 2025\\ndespite a continued reduction in energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP). The\\nChina report suggests that the nation’s emissions can be reduced by 21%, butachieving this reduction is predicated upon adopting measures and policies whichwould entail considerable costs. In each of the study countries, restraining thegrowth of energy use, and consequent emissions, would require that the energyintensity of the economy declines or increases less between now and 2025 and/orthat each country shift to the use of less carbon-intensive fuels.\\nThe studies indicated that the greatest opportunity for reducing emissions in the\\nstudied countries lies in improving energy e\\x81ciency. Given the limited alternativeresources of oil and gas everywhere, except in the GCC countries, Venezuela andRussia, the potential for switching among domestic fuels is limited and, due to thescarcity of hard currency, the prospect of importing these fuels appears bleak.Achieving the potential gains associated with improved energy e\\x81ciency will entail aconcerted e/C128ort on the part of consumers, manufacturers, energy-supply companiesand governments. The results of the country studies provide a range of options forsurmounting the potential obstacles to energy e\\x81ciency improvements. Mechanisms\\nare needed which would provide incentives for these groups to work together towards\\nthe common goal of more e\\x81cient energy production and use. Requiring large indus-tries to prepare an energy e\\x81ciency-impact statement and providing incentives in theform of tax breaks is one approach to improving the e\\x81ciency of new products. Incen-tives for the accelerated replacement and decommissioning of existing equipment areimportant to reduce the energy currently wasted in carrying out many end-use activities.\\nWhile improving energy e\\x81ciency will slow the growth of energy use and carbon\\nemissions, it will not reverse the trend towards increased energy use required to sup-\\nport economic growth. Dramatically decreasing the energy requirements of economic\\ndevelopment would require fundamental changes in the way societies develop.Increased use of power and motive force, higher comfort levels and the desire forgreater convenience is the current paradigm in industrialized countries which nor-mally leads to an increase in carbon emissions. The emulation of this paradigm hasalready led to urban blight in most developing countries.\\nConsequently, it is important to point out that a signiﬁcant characteristic of each\\nof the examples of regional and global pollution problems mentioned above is that\\nthe nature and magnitudes of the damages caused are subject to major uncertainties.\\nFor example, in the acid rain, uncertainties relate mainly to the magnitudes of thephysical and biological e/C128ects, rather than to be nature of the e/C128ects themselves, andto the transformation of these physical and biological impacts into economicdamages. For ozone depletion, uncertainties are far more comprehensive becausethe phenomenon of ozone depletion is not well understood and research conductedon ozone depletion is based mostly on model-oriented studies. In addition, there arevarious uncertainties in terms of the processes and consequences of global climate\\nchange, such as the regional impacts of the various manifestations of the process\\nand the timing of the changes and their consequences.I. Dincer, M.A. Rosen / Applied Energy 64 (1999) 427–440 4333. Some potential solutions to current environmental issues\\nRecently, some potential solutions have evolved regarding the possible problems\\nassociated with CO 2emissions, including: energy conservation through improved\\nenergy e\\x81ciency, a reduction in the usage of fossil fuels and an increase in the supply\\nof environmentally benign energy forms, which is leading to the use of renewableenergy sources and technologies, acceleration of forestation to absorb CO\\n2, and\\nreduced energy usage by changing life styles and increasing public awareness.\\nIt is important to mention that there are some possibilities to substitute fossil fuels\\n(i.e., coal and oil) by alternative fuels or fuels with less carbon content. For example,in the case of the iron and steel industry, it is di\\x81cult to operate blast furnaces with\\noil or gas, but energy-intensive industries, such as the cement and paper industries\\nuse less coal and more gas. The mechanical and the assembly industries can utilizemainly gas, which is easy to handle and control. However, it is necessary to accel-erate this substitution by appropriate subsidies to overcome price barriers, which arethe major obstacles for many industrial applications.\\nBelow we discuss two of the most important options, namely energy conservation\\nand use of renewable energy technologies.\\n3.1. Energy conservation and energy e\\x81ciency\\nA number of factors are considered to be important in determining the future level\\nof a country’s energy consumption and production, including population growth,\\neconomic performance, consumer tastes, technological developments, governmentpolicies concerning the energy sector, and developments on world energy markets.\\nEnergy resources and their utilization are intimately related to sustainable devel-\\nopment. For societies to attain or try to attain sustainable development, much e/C128ort\\nmust be devoted not only to discovering sustainable energy resources, but also to\\nincreasing the energy e\\x81ciencies of processes utilizing these resources. Under thesecircumstances, increasing the e\\x81ciency of energy-utilizing devices is important. Dueto increased awareness of the beneﬁts of e\\x81ciency improvements, many institutes andagencies have started working along these lines. Many energy conservation and e\\x81-ciency improvement programmes have been and are being developed to reduce pre-sent levels of energy consumption. To implement these programmes in a beneﬁcialmanner, an understanding is required of the patterns of ‘‘energy carrier’’ consump-\\ntion, for example, the type of energy carrier used, factors that inﬂuence consumption,\\nand types of end-uses [13].\\nEnergy conservation involves e\\x81ciency improvements, formulation of pricing\\npolicies, good ‘‘housekeeping practices,’’ and load management strategies, amongother measures. A signiﬁcant reduction in consumer energy costs can occur ifconservation measures are adopted appropriately. The payback period for manyconservation programmes is less than two years. In recent years, an energy con-servation programme has been introduced [14] for the electrical sector in India that\\nis considered both technically feasible and economically promising. In spite of the\\npotentially signiﬁcant beneﬁts of such programmes to the economy and their proven434 I. Dincer, M.A. Rosen / Applied Energy 64 (1999) 427–440successes in several countries, conservation programmes have not yet been under-\\ntaken on a signiﬁcant scale in many developed and developing countries. Some rea-sons for this lack of conservation programmes relate to the following factors:\\n.technical (e.g. lack of availability, reliability, and knowledge of e\\x81cient tech-nologies),\\n.institutional (e.g., lack of appropriate technical input, ﬁnancial support, andproper programme design and monitoring expertise),\\n.ﬁnancial (e.g., lack of explicit ﬁnancing mechanisms),\\n.managerial (e.g., inappropriate programme management practices and sta/C128training),\\n.pricing policy (e.g., inappropriate pricing of electricity and other energy com-modities), and\\n.information di/C128usion (e.g., lack of appropriate information).\\nReduced energy consumption (through conservation) programmes can beneﬁt not\\nonly consumers and utilities, but society as well. In particular, reduced energy con-sumption generally leads to reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollu-tants into the environment.\\nEnergy conservation is vital for sustainable development and should be imple-\\nmented by all possible means, despite the fact that it has its own limitations. This isnot only required for us but for the next generation as well. Energy conservation is ofgreat importance in terms of sectoral energy utilization and Table 2 is an example toshow the potential energy savings in British industry which used 2410 PJ of energy in1986. As can be seen from the table, the scope for industrial energy savings is between24 and 34% of the total industrial fuel used. Of course, this is only a generalization.Some industries, particularly, those where appreciable quantities of high grade waste\\nheat are produced, lend themselves to waste-energy recovery far better than others,\\nwhich need mainly mechanical and electrical energy. Furthermore, there is no doubtthat some factories are already run along extremely energy economical lines, whileothers are negligent in this respect.\\nTable 2\\nPotential scope for energy savings in British industrya\\nType of energy saving Amount (PJ)\\nWaste heat recovery 216–288\\nWaste as fuel 108–180\\nImproved instrumentation and control 72–108Heat pumps 36\\nProcess insulation 36\\nImproved drying and evaporation practice 36\\nIndustrial combined heat and power plants 36\\nImproved methods of driving machinery 72–108Total savings 612–828\\naSource. [2].I. Dincer, M.A. Rosen / Applied Energy 64 (1999) 427–440 435Furthermore, some technical limitations on energy conservation are associated with\\nthe laws of physics and thermodynamics. Other technical limitations are imposed by\\npractical technical constraints related to the real-world devices that are used. For\\nexample, the minimum amount of fuel theoretically needed to produce a speciﬁed\\nquantity of electricity could be determined by considering a Carnot (ideal) heat-engine. However, more than this theoretical minimum fuel may be needed due topractical technical matters such as the maximum temperatures and pressures thatstructures and materials in the power plant can withstand\\nAs environmental concerns such as pollution, ozone depletion and global-climate\\nchange became major issues in the 1980s, interest developed in the link betweenenergy utilization and the environment. Since then, there has been increasing atten-\\ntion to this linkage. Many scientists and engineers suggest that the impact of energy-\\nresource utilization on the environment is best addressed by considering exergy. Theexergy of a quantity of energy or a substance is a measure of the usefulness orquality of the energy or substance, or a measure of its potential to cause change.Exergy appears to be an e/C128ective measure of the potential of a substance to impactthe environment. In practice, the author feels that a thorough understanding ofexergy and how exergy analysis can provide insights into the e\\x81ciency and perfor-mance of energy systems are required for the engineer or scientist working in the\\narea of energy systems and the environment. Although many studies exist concern-\\ning the close relationship between energy and the environment, there have beenlimited works on the link between exergy and environment concepts [19–21]. Inaddition, exergy analysis has recently been proposed by many scientists and engi-neers as a technique for thermodynamic assessment that overcomes most, if not all,of the problems associated with energy analysis [15,16].\\n3.2. Renewable energy technologies\\nThe operating and ﬁnancial attributes of renewable energy technologies, which\\ninclude modularity and ﬂexibility, low operating costs (suggesting relative cost cer-\\ntainty), are considerably di/C128erent from those for traditional, fossil based technologies,whose attributes include large capital investments, long implementation lead times, andoperating cost uncertainties, regarding future fuel costs. The overall beneﬁts of renew-able energy technologies are often not well understood and consequently they are oftenevaluated to be not as cost e/C128ective as traditional technologies. In order to assess com-\\nprehensively renewable technologies, however, some of their beneﬁts that are often not\\nconsidered must be accounted for. Renewable energy technologies, in general, aresometimes seen as direct substitutes for existing technologies so that their beneﬁts andcosts are conceived in terms of assessment methods developed for the existing technol-ogy. For example, solar and other renewable energy technologies can provide smallincremental capacity additions to existing energy systems with short lead times. Suchpower generation units usually provide more ﬂexibility in incremental supply thanlarge, long lead-time units such as nuclear power stations.\\nThe development of renewable energy other than hydro-electric power has in part been\\nlimited by the focus of electric utilities on fossil and nuclear energy options. Non-fossil436 I. Dincer, M.A. Rosen / Applied Energy 64 (1999) 427–440energy farms will nevertheless likely have a role in abating greenhouse gas emissions,\\nalthough the scale of this contribution will likely be limited in the short term.\\n4. Energy and sustainable development\\nA secure supply of energy resources is generally agreed to be a necessary but not\\nsu\\x81cient requirement for development within a society. Furthermore, sustainable\\ndevelopment demands a sustainable supply of energy resources. The implications ofthese statements are numerous, and depend on how sustainable is deﬁned.\\nOne important implication of these statements is that sustainable development within\\na society requires a supply of energy resources that, in the long term, is readily andsustainably available at reasonable cost and can be utilized for all required tasks with-out causing negative societal impacts. Supplies of such energy resources as fossil fuels(coal, oil, and natural gas) and uranium are generally acknowledged to be ﬁnite; otherenergy sources such as sunlight, wind and falling water are generally consideredrenewable and therefore sustainable over the relatively long term. Wastes (convertibleto useful energy forms through, for example, waste-to-energy incineration facilities)and biomass fuels are also usually viewed as sustainable energy sources.\\nA second implication of the initial statements in this section is that sustainable\\ndevelopment requires that energy resources be used as e\\x81ciently as possible [4,5]. Inthis way, society maximizes the beneﬁts it derives from utilizing its energy resources,while minimizing the negative impacts (such as environmental damage) associated withtheir use. This implication acknowledges that all energy resources are to some degreeﬁnite, so that greater e\\x81ciency in utilization allows such resources to contribute todevelopment over a longer period of time, i.e., to make development more sustainable.Even for energy sources that may eventually become inexpensive and widely avail-\\nable, increases in energy e\\x81ciency will remain sought after to reduce the resource\\nrequirements (energy, material, etc.) to create and maintain systems and devices toharvest the energy, and to reduce the associated environmental impacts.\\nThe ﬁrst implication, clearly being essential to sustainable development, has been\\nand continues to be widely discussed. The second implication, which relates to theimportance and role of energy e\\x81ciency in achieving sustainable development, is lessdiscussed and understood.\\n5. Environment and sustainable development\\nEnvironmental concerns are an important factor in sustainable development. For\\na variety of reasons, activities which continually degrade the environment are not\\nsustainable over time, e.g., the cumulative impact on the environment of suchactivities often leads over time to a variety of health, ecological and other problems.\\nA large portion of the environmental impact in a society is associated with its\\nutilization of energy resources. Ideally, a society seeking sustainable developmentutilizes only energy resources which cause no environmental impact (e.g., whichI. Dincer, M.A. Rosen / Applied Energy 64 (1999) 427–440 437release no emissions to the environment). However, since all energy resources lead to\\nsome environmental impact, it is reasonable to suggest that some (not all) of theconcerns regarding the limitations imposed on sustainable development by environ-\\nmental emissions and their negative impacts can be in part overcome through\\nincreased energy e\\x81ciency. Clearly, a strong relation exists between energy e\\x81ciencyand environmental impact since, for the same services or products, less resourceutilization and pollution is normally associated with increased energy e\\x81ciency.\\nImproved energy e\\x81ciency leads to reduced energy losses. Most e\\x81ciency\\nimprovements produce direct environmental beneﬁts in two ways. First, energyinput requirements are reduced per unit output, and pollutants generated are corre-spondingly reduced. Second, consideration of the entire life cycle for energy resour-\\nces and technologies suggests that improved e\\x81ciency reduces environmental impact\\nduring most stages of the life cycle.\\n6. Illustrative example\\nThe contribution to sustainable development in a society, possible through the\\nprovision of heat and electricity services through cogeneration rather than through\\nseparate processes for heat production and electricity generation, is considered,\\nbased on the results of a previous study [17]. The key points demonstrated are that,for the several scenarios considered, energy use and environmental emissionsdecrease in a society through cogeneration, e.g., annual electricity consumptiondecreases by as much as 30%, permitting annual electrical generation to decreasecorrespondingly; annual fuel use and related emissions for the electrical utility sectorboth decrease by up to 47%; and, excluding the electrical utility sector, the society’sannual use of fossil fuels and the corresponding annual emissions both decrease by\\nup to 15%. It is noted that this is but one limited illustration of how increased\\nenergy e\\x81ciency can contribute to sustainable development. Numerous other areasin which increased energy e\\x81ciency can contribute exist in any society.\\n7. Conclusions\\nEnergy resources and their utilization are intimately related to sustainable devel-\\nopment. For societies to attain or try to attain sustainable development, much e/C128ort\\nmust be devoted not only to discovering sustainable energy resources, but also toincreasing the energy e\\x81ciencies of processes utilizing these resources. Further,environmental concerns must be addressed. Several important observations can bedrawn from the present study as follows:\\n.Action will be required on a considerable scale if stabilization or reduction ofgreenhouse gas emissions is to be achieved.\\n.There exist numerous scientiﬁc uncertainties regarding many of the detailsassociated with the global-warming problem. Much debate is occurring438 I. Dincer, M.A. Rosen / Applied Energy 64 (1999) 427–440regarding the predicted qualitative and quantitative impacts of global warming,\\nand the timing for the e/C128ects.\\n.Although energy industries will be signiﬁcantly impacted by shifts towards\\nsustainable development, they have in the past demonstrated a capacity to\\nrespond if prompted by government actions and other factors.\\n.Although the mix of non-fossil, nuclear and renewable energy sources mayvary as e/C128orts are made to promote sustainability, a main contribution is goingto come from increased energy e\\x81ciency.\\n.Market-based regulatory instruments, such as carbon or fuel taxes, will remaina vital component of policies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and otherpollutants, since e/C128orts to increase energy e\\x81ciency and reduce environmental\\nimpact are usually unsupportable against a background of low prices.\\n.In sectors where consumers do not purchase devices with improved e\\x81ciency\\nand environment characteristics, market signals will certainly have to be sup-plemented by more direct government intervention (e.g., transport anddomestic appliances are often purchased with little attention to e\\x81ciency andenvironmental impact).\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors are grateful for the support provided for this work by King Fahd\\nUniversity of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia, and by the Natural Sciencesand Engineering Research Council and Ryerson Polytechnic University in Canada.\\nReferences\\n[1] Anon.

A possible\\nsynthesis of energy-based and mainstream models is presented. This shows that when energy is scarce it imposes a\\nstrong constraint on the growth of the economy; however, when energy is abundant, its effect on economic growth\\nis much reduced. The industrial revolution released the constraints on economic growth by the development of newmethods of using coal and the discovery of new fossil fuel resources. Time-series analysis shows that energy and GDP\\ncointegrate, and energy use Granger causes GDP when capital and other production inputs are included in the vector\\nautoregression model. However, various mechanisms can weaken the links between energy and growth. Energy usedper unit of economic output has declined in developed and some developing countries, owing to both technological\\nchange and a shift from poorer quality fuels, such as coal, to the use of higher quality fuels, especially electricity.\\nSubstitution of other inputs for energy and sectoral shifts in economic activity play smaller roles.\\nKeywords: energy; economic growth; technological change; substitution; industrial revolution\\nPreferred citation: David I.

So,\\nis energy an important driver of economic growth\\nand development and, if so, what factors affect the\\nstrength of the relationship between energy andgrowth? This paper attempts to answer these ques-\\ntions by surveying the literature and bringing some\\nof the strands together in a synthesis.

Therefore, I ﬁrst reviewbasic physical principles and economic concepts\\nthat deﬁne the role of energy in economic produc-\\ntion. Because thermodynamics implies that energyis essential to all economic production, criticism of\\nmainstream economic growth models that ignore\\nenergy is legitimate. On the other hand, theories thattry to explain growth entirely as a function of en-\\nergy supply, while ignoring the roles of information,\\nknowledge, and institutions, are also incomplete.\\nHowever, institutions also affect how these roles\\nplay out and, therefore, the mainstream theory of\\neconomic growth, which focuses on these con-\\nsiderations, is reviewed next.

This shows that when energyis scarce it will strongly constrain economic growth,\\nbut when energy becomes more abundant it is much\\nless of a limiting factor and the conventional main-stream model explains economic growth fairly well.\\nIn recent decades, and in some cases over much\\nlonger periods, signiﬁcant reductions in energy in-tensity have been achieved in many developed and\\nsome developing countries.\\n4,5I use a production\\nfunction approach to examine the factors that couldreduce or strengthen the linkage between energy use\\nand economic activity over time. The key factors are\\nas follows:\\n•substitution between energy and other inputs\\nwithin an existing technology;\\n•technological change;\\n•shifts in the composition of the energy input;\\nand\\n•shifts in the composition of economic output.\\nI dedicate a subsection to the discussion of each\\nof these themes. Penultimately, I review the empiri-\\ncal evidence on the causal link between energy and\\ngrowth focusing on reduced form time-series mod-els that do not specify the structural linkages be-\\ntween energy and output. This literature shows that\\nenergy and gross domestic product (GDP) cointe-grate and energy use Granger causes GDP when\\ncapital and other production inputs are included in\\nthe vector autoregression model. The ﬁnal sectionof the paper presents conclusions.\\nEnergy as a factor of production\\nThe laws of thermodynamics and the conservation\\nof matter describe the immutable constraints within\\nwhich the economic system must operate.\\n6,7The\\nmass-balance principle means that, in order to ob-\\ntain a given material output, greater or equal quan-\\ntities of matter must be used as inputs with theresidual a pollutant or waste product.\\n6Therefore,there are minimal material input requirements for\\nany production process producing material outputs.\\nThe second law of thermodynamics (the efﬁciencylaw) implies that a minimum quantity of energy is\\nrequired to carry out the transformation or move-\\nment of matter or, more generally, perform physicalwork. Carrying out transformations in ﬁnite time\\nrequires more energy than these minima.\\n8All pro-\\nduction involves work. Therefore, all economic ac-\\ntivities must require energy, and there must be limits\\nto the substitution of other factors of production forenergy so that energy is always an essential factor of\\nproduction.\\n9\\nSome inputs to production are nonreproducible,\\nwhile others can be manufactured, at a cost, within\\nthe economic production system and are said to be\\nreproducible. Capital, labor, and, in the longer term,even natural resources, are reproducible factors of\\nproduction, while energy and matter are nonrepro-\\nducible factors of production. Energy vectors—fuelsand electricity—and raw materials such as minerals\\nare in theory reproducible factors, though with the\\nexception of agricultural and forest products theyare usually harvested from nature and represent the\\naccumulated work of the planet’s biogeochemical\\ncycles, which in turn are powered by energy from\\nthe sun and the Earth’s internal heat.\\nAs neither energy nor matter is reproducible they\\nmust be captured from the environment with im-\\nplied environmental disruption. This is especially\\nrelevant for energy, as due to the entropy law,exergy—useful energy—cannot be recycled. While\\nsome forms of energy capture are possibly more\\nhazardous to human health or damaging to environ-mental quality, all methods—nuclear energy, fossil\\nfuels, hydropower, wind power, biomass, etc.—are\\nenvironmentally disruptive. Solar energy is very dif-fuse compared to the concentrated stocks of fossil\\nfuels and plants and animals are very inefﬁcient con-\\nverters of that energy into exergy and useful work,so that large quantities of energy must be invested to\\nobtain a given amount of net energy.\\n10This is why\\nthe shift to fossil fuels in the industrial revolution\\nreleased the prevalent constraints on energy supply,\\nand therefore, on production and growth.11\\nSome aspects of organized matter—that is\\ninformation—might also be considered to be non-\\nreproducible inputs in the same way as energyis.\\n12–14Energy is necessary to extract information\\nfrom the environment while active use of energy\\nAnn.

Obviously, energy can\\nprovide uncontrolled heating, lighting, etc., withoutany activity on the part of economic agents. But even\\nnonintelligent organisms need to use (genetic) in-\\nformation to make controlled use of energy. Unlikeenergy, information and knowledge cannot be eas-\\nily quantiﬁed. However, the fact that they must be\\nincorporated into machines, workers, and materi-\\nals in order to be made useful provides a biophysical\\njustiﬁcation for treating capital, labor, etc., as factorsof production. Though capital and labor are easier\\nto measure than information and knowledge, their\\nmeasurement is, still, very imperfect compared tothat of energy.\\nPrimary factors of production are deﬁned as in-\\nputs that exist at the beginning of the period un-der consideration and are not directly used up in\\nproduction (though they can be degraded or accu-\\nmulated from period to period), while intermediateinputs are those created during the production pe-\\nriod under consideration and are used up entirely in\\nproduction. Mainstream economists usually thinkof capital, labor, and land as the primary factors of\\nproduction, and goods (such as fuels and materials)\\nas intermediate inputs. The prices paid for the vari-\\nous intermediate inputs are seen as eventually being\\npayments to the owners of the primary inputs forthe services provided directly or embodied in the\\nproduced intermediate inputs. This approach has\\nled to a focus in mainstream growth theory on theprimary inputs, and in particular, capital and labor.\\nThe classical factor of land, including all natural re-\\nsource inputs, gradually diminished in importancein economic theory as its value share of GDP fell\\nsteadily in the 20th century\\n15and today is usually\\nsubsumed as a subcategory of capital.\\nThe mainstream theory of growth\\nBackground: growth theory\\nThe core mainstream growth models, including the\\nSolow16growth model and later developments,2do\\nnot include resources or energy. In the Solow model,\\nthe long-run rate of economic growth is given by therate of technological progress while diminishing re-\\nturns to capital mean that growth derived from capi-\\ntal accumulation is a transitional phase as the econ-\\nomy moves toward this long-run dynamic steady\\nstate. If the savings rate is increased, growth will oc-cur for a while until a new equilibrium is reached,though, the higher the savings rate, the lower the\\ncurrent standard of living of the population. Im-\\nprovement in the state of technological knowledgeraises the rate of return to capital, thereby offsetting\\nthe diminishing returns to capital that would other-\\nwise apply a brake to growth. Without technologicalchange, economic growth eventually halts but the\\neconomy can remain in a steady state indeﬁnitely.\\nEarly growth models did not explain how im-\\nprovements in technology come about, so that these\\nmodels are said to have exogenous technologicalchange. More recent models attempt to endoge-\\nnize technological change—explaining technologi-\\ncal progress as the outcome of decisions taken byﬁrms and individuals. Early endogenous growth\\nmodels, such as Arrow’s learning by doing model\\n17\\nor Hicks’ induced innovation model,18allowed the\\nstate of technology to respond to changes in one\\nof the variables in the model but do not explic-\\nitly model this as an optimizing process. More re-cent endogenous growth models are represented by\\nthe so-called AK models, which do not explicitly\\nmodel research and development activities (R&D),and Schumpeterian growth models that do. In AK\\nmodels, the relationship between capital and out-\\nput can be written in the form Y=AK,w h e r e A\\nis a constant and Kis a composite of manufactured\\ncapital and disembodied technological knowledgeis thought of as a form of capital. T echnological\\nknowledge is a nonrival good and thus is not de-\\npleted with use, and it generates positive external-ities in production that beneﬁt the economy as a\\nwhole. The economy can sustain a constant growth\\nrate in which the diminishing returns to manufac-tured capital are exactly offset by the external effect\\nof knowledge creation. In AKmodels, saving is di-\\nrected to either manufactured capital accumulationor the increase of knowledge. The growth rate is per-\\nmanently inﬂuenced by the savings rate; a higher\\nsavings rate increases the economy’s growth rate,not merely its equilibrium level of income.\\n19\\nIn Schumpterian growth models, there is imper-\\nfect competition in the capital goods industry and\\nﬁrms invest in R&D in order to receive monopoly\\nproﬁts.20Innovations appear stochastically and are\\nembodied in new generations of capital or consumer\\ngoods.

Both capi-\\ntal accumulation and innovation can determine the\\nlong-run growth rate. However, if there are dimin-ishing returns in the innovation sector as technology\\nbecomes more complex, the economy could have a\\nconstant growth rate.\\n20\\nGrowth models with resources and no\\ntechnical change\\nAdding nonrenewable natural resources that are\\nessential in production to the basic mainstream\\ngrowth models means that capital also needs tobe accumulated to compensate for resource deple-\\ntion. Renewable but ﬁnite inputs, such as solar en-\\nergy, also can pose problems. Nondeclining out-\\nput is no longer guaranteed but instead depends\\non both the nature of technology and institutionalarrangements.\\n21,22When there is more than one\\ninput—both capital and natural resources—there\\nare many alternative paths that economic growthcan take, determined by both the nature of tech-\\nnology and institutional arrangements. T echnical\\nconditions include the mix of renewable and non-renewable resources, the initial endowments of cap-\\nital and natural resources, and the ease of substi-\\ntution among inputs. The institutional setting in-cludes market structure (competition versus central\\nplanning), the system of property rights (private\\nversus common property, etc.), and the system ofvalues regarding the welfare of future generations.\\nModels can attempt to either maximize the sum of\\ndiscounted social welfare over some relevant time\\nhorizon or achieve sustainability (nondeclining so-\\ncial welfare).\\nSolow showed that sustainability is achievable\\ni nam o d e lw i t han o n r e n e w a b l en a t u r a lr e s o u r c e\\nwith no extraction costs and nondepreciating cap-ital when the elasticity of substitution between the\\ntwo inputs is unity, and when certain other tech-\\nnical conditions are met.\\n21Sustainability, and even\\nindeﬁnite growth in consumption, can occur when\\nthe utility of individuals is given equal weight with-\\nout regard to when they happen to live. However,under competition the same model economy results\\nin exhaustion of the resource and consumption and\\nsocial welfare eventually fall to zero.\\n22Dasgupta and\\nHeal show that with any constant discount rate the\\nefﬁcient growth path also leads to eventual deple-\\ntion of the natural resource and the collapse of theeconomy.\\n23The Hartwick rule shows that if sus-tainability is technically feasible, a constant level of\\nconsumption can be achieved by reinvesting the re-\\nsource rents in other forms of capital, which in turncan substitute for resources.\\n24Dixit et al.25extended\\nthe rule to multiple capital stocks while Hartwick26\\nextended the rule to open economies. It is difﬁcult\\nto apply this rule in practice, as the rents and capital\\nmust be valued at sustainability compatible prices,\\nthat is, the prices that would emerge if the sustain-\\nability constraint were imposed.27–29In a practical\\nsense, such prices are unknowable given that we havepoor understanding of even the costs of current en-\\nvironmental damage and resource depletion or of\\nthe future development of the economy.\\nA common interpretation of this body of work\\nis that substitution and technical change can effec-\\ntively decouple economic growth from the use ofenergy and other resources. Depleted resources can\\nbe replaced by more abundant substitutes, or by\\n“equivalent” forms of human-made capital (peo-ple, machines, factories, etc.). But this is a misinter-\\npretation. Solow\\n21and others assume ap r i o r i that\\nsustainability is technically feasible and explicitlydispose of cases where the elasticity of substitu-\\ntion between nonrenewable resources and capital\\nis greater or less than unity. In the former case,\\nsubstitution possibilities are large and, therefore,\\nthe possibility of nonsustainability is not an is-sue. In the latter case, sustainability is not feasible\\nif an economy uses only nonrenewable resources,\\nthough sustainability is technically feasible whenresources are renewable, at least in the absence of\\npopulation growth. However, there is a tendency\\namong mainstream economists to assume thatsustainability is technically feasible unless proven\\notherwise.\\n30–32\\nGrowth models with resources and technical\\nchange\\nIn addition to substitution of capital for resources,\\ntechnological change might permit growth or at\\nleast constant consumption in the face of a ﬁnite\\nresource base.

An aim of muchof this literature is to determine whether, and under\\nwhat circumstances, technical progress is effective\\nin ensuring sustained consumption.\\n42As noted ear-\\nlier, due to externalities in knowledge production,\\nthere may be too little innovation in an endogenous\\ngrowth world. As a result, depletion of a nonre-newable resource is nonoptimal, but this rate could\\nbe either too fast or too slow. A general ﬁnding is\\nthat the rate of resource augmenting progress mustbe strictly positive and at least equal to the discount\\nrate to obtain nondeclining consumption in the long\\nrun.\\n39Aghion and Howitt20found that an AK-type\\nmodel with essential nonrenewable resources can-\\nnot allow for unbounded growth in consumption\\nwhile a Schumpetarian-type model can. A Schum-\\npetarian model with a renewable resource that af-\\nfects utility directly can allow unlimited growth, butonly under unlikely assumptions. But if the renew-\\nable resources do not affect utility, continued growth\\nwould be easier than in the nonrenewable case.\\nThe ecological economics approach\\nIntroduction\\nEcological economists derive their view of the\\nrole of energy in economic growth from the bio-\\nphysical foundations of the economy discussedearlier.\\n10,43–50This view is shared by some geog-\\nraphers51and economic historians11,52who also\\nbelieve that energy plays a crucial role in eco-nomic growth, as well as being an important fac-\\ntor in explaining the industrial revolution. Ecologi-\\ncal economists also argue that substitution betweencapital and resources and technological progress can\\nonly play limited roles in mitigating the scarcity of\\nresources.\\n9Some ecological economists also down-\\nplay the role of technological change, arguing that\\neither increased energy use accounts for most ap-\\nparent productivity growth, or that technologicalchange is real but innovations mainly increase pro-ductivity by allowing the use of more energy.\\n10,45,47\\nTherefore, increased energy use is the main or only\\ncause of economic growth.\\nA prominent tradition in ecological economics\\nis represented by biophysical models that consider\\nenergy to be a primary factor of production and theonly such primary factor. In this view, all value is\\nderived from the action of energy that is directed by\\ncapital and labor. The ﬂow of energy in the economy\\nis the service of the reservoirs of fossil fuels and the\\nsun, which represent the primary input in our ter-minology. In some biophysical economic models,\\ngeological constraints ﬁx the rate of energy extrac-\\ntion so that the ﬂow rather than the stock can beconsidered a primary input.\\n53On the other hand,\\ncapital and labor are treated as ﬂows of capital con-\\nsumption and labor services rather than as stocks,in other words, they are considered as intermedi-\\nate inputs that are created and maintained by the\\nprimary input of energy and ﬂows of matter. Thelevel of the ﬂows is computed in terms of the em-\\nbodied energy use associated with them. Prices of\\ncommodities should then be determined by em-bodied energy cost\\n54—a normative energy theory\\nof value—or are seen as actually correlated with\\nenergy cost44—a positive energy theory of value.55\\nAssuming that there are constant returns to scale, wecan represent the production process of the econ-omy as a whole by a Leontief input–output model\\nwith a single primary factor of production.\\n56This\\ntheory—like the Marxian paradigm—must then ex-plain how labor, capital, etc., end up receiving part\\nof the surplus. Energy surplus must be appropriated\\nby the owners of labor, capital, and land\\n10,44,53,57\\nwith the actual distribution of the surplus depend-\\ning on the relative bargaining power of the different\\nsocial classes and foreign suppliers of fuel.57\\nBecause information is also an important fac-\\ntor of production it is difﬁcult to argue for a\\nmodel where energy is the sole factor of produc-tion. For example, the quality of resources such\\nas oil reservoirs—as measured by depth, pressure,\\netc.—is critical in determining the energy required\\nto extract and process fuels and other intermediate\\nresource ﬂows, which increases as the quality of re-sources declines over time with depletion.

Thus, changing resource quality\\nis represented by changes in the embodied energy\\nof the primary resources themselves. An alternativeapproach is to measure material and energy inputs\\non the common basis of their exergy.\\n59,60But both\\napproaches seem too reductionist. Other servicesprovided by nature, such as nutrient recycling, the\\nprovision of clean air and water, pollination, the\\nclimate system, and so on, should also then be ac-\\ncounted for. These ecosystem services provide the\\nconditions that make economic production—andlife itself—possible. Georgescu-Roegen formulated\\na more ﬂexible approach with a variety of dif-\\nferent types of factors of production.\\n43The neo-\\nRicardian models61developed by Perrings62and\\nO’Connor63also allow any number of inputs while\\ncomplying with thermodynamic and mass-balanceconstraints.\\nEnergy return on investment and economic\\noutput\\nEnergy return on investment (EROI) is the ratio\\nof useful energy produced by a method of energy\\nsupply to the amount of energy invested in extract-\\ning that energy. Lower quality energy resources havelower EROIs. Biophysical economists argue that the\\nmore energy that is required to extract energy, the\\nless energy is available for other uses and the pooreran economy will be. In preindustrial societies, most\\nworkers were engaged in growing food and collect-\\ning fuel. Only a small fraction of society could usethe small energy surplus generated to produce other\\nproducts and services. In this view, the increase in\\nEROI allowed by the switch from biomass to fos-sil fuels enabled the industrial revolution and the\\nperiod of modern economic growth that followed\\nit.\\n10\\nDeclining EROI would threaten not just growth\\nbut also the level of output of the economy and,therefore, sustainability. Murphy and Hall docu-\\nment EROI for many energy sources, arguing that\\nit is declining over time.\\n50Wind and direct solar\\nenergy have more favorable EROIs than biomass\\nfuels but worse than most fossil fuels. However, un-\\nlike fossil fuels, the EROI of these energy sourcestends to improve over time with innovation.\\n64But\\ncurrent usage is very small, and Murphy and Hall\\nargue that there is no prospect of them replac-ing a large part of fossil fuel usage in the near\\nfuture.Declining EROI could be mitigated by substitut-\\ning other inputs for energy or by improving the\\nefﬁciency with which energy is used. However, bio-physical economics argues that both these processes\\nhave limits.\\nLimits to substitution\\nSubstitution can occur within a category of similar\\nproduction inputs—for example between different\\nfuels—and between different categories of inputs—\\nfor example between energy and machines. Thereis also a distinction to be made between substi-\\ntution at the microlevel—for example in a single\\nengineering process or in a single ﬁrm—and atthe macrolevel—in the economy as a whole. Fi-\\nnally, some types of substitution that are possible\\nin a single country are not possible globally. We\\ncan classify inputs as good or poor substitutes as\\nmeasured by the Hicks or direct elasticity of sub-stitution.\\n65This elasticity reﬂects movement along\\nan isoquant of the production function holding\\nall other inputs constant. It can take values fromzero (Leontief function) to inﬁnity (linear produc-\\ntion). Good and poor substitutes have elasticities\\nof substitution of greater than and less than unity,respectively.\\nSolow argues that the within-category substitu-\\ntion, and in particular the substitution of renewablefor nonrenewable resources, is most important and\\nseems to assume that new substitutes will always\\nbe found.\\n32It is possible that the elasticity of sub-\\nstitution for within-category types of substitution\\nexceeds unity. The long-run pattern of energy use in\\nindustrial economies has been dominated by sub-stitutions from wood and waterpower to coal, oil,\\nnatural gas and primary electricity (see Fig. 1).\\n10,66\\nWhen fossil fuels are economically exhausted, the\\nnext stage of energy development may see a return\\nto solar energy, albeit captured in a more sophis-ticated way, rather than a move to a new substi-\\ntute.\\n67Meta-analysis of existing studies of interfuel\\nsubstitution suggests that the long-run elasticities ofsubstitution at the level of the industrial sector as a\\nwhole for oil–coal, oil–gas, oil–electricity, and gas–\\nelectricity pairs are signiﬁcantly greater than unity.The remaining elasticities—between coal and gas\\nand coal and electricity—are insigniﬁcantly differ-\\nent from unity or zero due to their large standarderrors. But there seems to be less substitutability at\\nthe macrolevel.\\n68\\nAnn. N.Y. Acad.

Ameta-analysis of the existing empirical literature\\nﬁnds that the elasticity of substitution between cap-\\nital and energy is less than unity.\\n70\\nThermodynamic limits to substitution can be eas-\\nily identiﬁed for individual processes but determin-\\ning such limits for more complex technologies isdifﬁcult.\\n71,72It might be argued that standard pro-\\nduction functions can account for mass balance and\\nthermodynamic constraints if the elasticity of sub-stitution between capital and resources is less than or\\nequal to unity so that resources are essential. When\\nthe elasticity of substitution is unity (Cobb–Douglas\\nproduction function), output is only zero when the\\nenergy input is zero (assuming positive nonenergyinputs), and strictly positive otherwise. This at least\\naccounts for the fact that some amount of energy\\nis required to produce goods and services but thatthis “essential” amount can be inﬁnitesimal if suf-\\nﬁcient manufactured capital is applied. Therefore,\\nthis condition does not satisfy thermodynamic con-siderations throughout the domain of the function.\\nThermodynamic limits can be approximated by aproduction function with an elasticity of substitu-\\ntion signiﬁcantly below unity.\\nGeorgescu-Roegen’s fund-ﬂow model describes\\nproduction as a transformation process in whicha ﬂow of materials, energy, and information—the\\nmaterial cause—is transformed by two agents of\\ntransformation, human labor, and manufacturedcapital—the efﬁcient cause.\\n73Thus, Daly argues\\nthat adding to the stock of pulp mills (efﬁcient\\ncause) does not produce an increase in pulp un-less there also is the wood ﬁber (material cause) to\\nfeed them.\\n74From this perspective, capital should\\nbe a poor substitute for energy and other resources.Mainstream economists think about this question\\ndifferently. First, they argue that though additional\\ncapital cannot conjure wood ﬁbers out of thin air,more capital and “smarter” capital can be used with\\neach amount of wood ﬁbers to produce more sophis-\\nticated and valuable products. There is then no limit\\nto the potential value of product created through\\nsophisticated manipulation using larger amounts ofcapital.\\n75\\nIn addition to these microeconomic limits to sub-\\nstitution, there may also be macroeconomic limitsto substitution. The construction, operation, and\\nmaintenance of tools, machines, and factories re-\\nquire a ﬂow of materials and energy. Similarly, thehumans that direct manufactured capital consume\\nenergy and materials in the form of food, water,\\n32 Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Thus, producing\\nmore of the “substitute” for energy—manufactured\\ncapital—requires more of the thing that it is sup-\\nposed to substitute for. This again limits potentialsubstitutability.\\n45,76–79\\nSubstitution does seem to be fundamentally more\\nconstrained at the economy-wide level of analysisthan at the microlevel of analysis. In Figure 2, the\\ncurve E=f(K) is an isoquant for a constant level\\nof output, where Eis energy, and Kis capital.\\n9The\\nindirect energy costs of materials are represented by\\ng(K) assuming, for simplicity, a constant energy cost\\nper unit of capital. The diagram also unrealisticallyassumes that no capital is required in the extrac-\\ntion or capture of energy. Addition of direct and\\nindirect energy costs results in the “net” isoquantE=h(K), which has a positive slope for extreme\\ncapital/energy ratios. But the energy requirements\\nof producing a unit of the capital input could also\\ndecrease if capital is also substituted for energy in\\nthe capital-producing sector of the economy. Thiswould be the case if we were modeling the effects of\\nan economy-wide tax on energy for example. How-\\never, a meta-analysis of the capital-energy elasticityof substitution shows a lower elasticity for more ag-\\ngregated sectors than for less aggregated sectors,\\n70\\nwhich supports the idea that substitution is more\\nrestricted at the economy-wide level.\\nKaufmann and Azary-Lee demonstrate the im-\\nportance of accounting for this physical interdepen-dency between manufactured and natural capital.\\n80\\nThey found that from 1958 to 1984 the indirect en-ergy costs of capital offset a signiﬁcant fraction ofthe direct fuel savings in the U.S. forest products\\nsector. In some years, the indirect energy costs of\\ncapital were greater than the direct fuel savings ofusing more capital.Limits to technological change\\nThe argument that resource augmenting techno-logical change can overcome limited substitutabilitywould be more convincing if technological change\\nwere really something different from substitution.\\nThis is not really the case. The neoclassical pro-duction function assumes that an inﬁnite number\\nof efﬁcient techniques coexist at any one point in\\ntime. Substitution occurs among these techniques.\\nC h a n g e si nt e c h n o l o g yo c c u rw h e nn e wm o r ee f -\\nﬁcient techniques are developed. However, thesenew techniques really represent the substitution of\\nknowledge for the other factors of production.

The endogenous technical\\nchange approach, represented by Galor and Weil\\n83\\nand Lucas,84emphasizes the role of human capi-\\ntal and fertility decisions in the transition. The rateof technological change in Galor and Weil’s model\\nis a function of the size of the population and the\\nlevel of education. Initially, there is a low technolog-ical change and education steady-state equilibrium.\\nAs population grows, a second high technological\\nchange and education equilibrium emerges, whicheventually is the only equilibrium.\\n85\\nThe second approach, represented by the work of\\nHansen and Prescott,86models the slow transition\\nfrom a stagnating traditional economic sector—the\\nMalthusian Sector—to a modern economic sector\\nthat experiences sustained economic growth—theSolow Sector. The “Malthusian Sector” depends on\\na land input and has decreasing returns to combined\\nlabor and capital. The modern “Solow Sector” does\\nnot use land and has constant returns to capital and\\nlabor combined. The transition starts when techni-cal change ﬁrst makes the operation of the modern\\ntechnology proﬁtable. Over time, the modern sec-\\ntor grows and the traditional sector declines as tech-nological progress increasingly reduces the cost of\\nproduction in the modern sector. Though Hansen\\nand Prescott note that the Solow sector probablyutilizes a technology that uses fossil fuels in place of\\nland, they do not model energy explicitly.\\nEconomic historians place a greater emphasis\\non the role of energy in the industrial revolution.\\nWrigley discussed the differential development of\\nthe Dutch and British economies.\\n11Both coun-\\ntries had the necessary institutions for the indus-\\ntrial revolution to occur, but capital accumulation in\\nthe Netherlands faced a renewable energy resource\\nconstraint while in Britain domestic coal mines pro-\\nvided a way out from the constraint. This explana-tion emphasizes low substitutability between capi-\\ntal and energy with newly available energy sources\\nrelaxing the binding constraint on capital accumu-lation. With restricted energy supplies, capital accu-\\nmulation faced rapidly diminishing returns.Allen places energy innovation center stage in his\\ntheory of why the industrial revolution occurred\\nin Britain.\\n52Like Wrigley, he compares Britain to\\nthe Netherlands as well as Belgium. These were the\\nmost developed economies in the world in the early\\nmodern age with much higher wages than elsewheredue to their dominant position in world commerce.\\nIn both countries the price of fuel wood was rising\\nin the early modern period relative to the price of\\ncoal. But the price ratio of traditional fuel to coal\\nwas higher in London than in the Low Countriesand even higher in the coalﬁeld areas of northeast-\\nern England and western Britain. Coal was lower\\nquality than wood as a heating and cooking fuelbut became a “backstop technology”\\n87once the rel-\\native price of wood to coal rose sufﬁciently, while in\\nthe Netherlands peat replaced coal. But innovationswere required in order to use coal effectively in new\\napplications from home heating and cooking to\\niron smelting. These induced innovations sparkedthe industrial revolution. Initially, the new innova-\\ntions were only proﬁtable in Britain where wages\\nrelative to energy prices were the highest in theworld. Continued innovation eventually made coal-\\nusing technologies proﬁtable in other countries\\ntoo. Wilkinson\\n88presented similar arguments, but\\nalso argued that no real welfare gains came from\\nthis Boserupian89response to scarcity. As a ﬁrst\\nstep to integrating the different approaches, I pro-\\npose to modify Solow’s growth model16by adding\\nan energy input that has low substitutability withcapital and labor, while allowing the elasticity of\\nsubstitution between capital and labor to remain\\nat unity. In this model, depending on the avail-ability of energy and the nature of technologi-\\ncal change, energy can be either a constraint on\\ngrowth or an enabler of growth.

ALand\\nAEare the augmentation indexes of labor and en-\\nergy, which can be interpreted as reﬂecting both\\nchanges in technology that augment the effective\\nsupply of the factor in question and changes inthe quality of the respective factors. Equation (2) is\\nthe equation of motion for capital that assumes like\\nSolow\\n16that the proportion of gross output that is\\ns a v e di sﬁ x e da t sa n dt h a tc a p i t a ld e p r e c i a t e sa ta\\nconstant rate /H9254. Equation (1) explicitly ignores land.\\nWe could see it as a model of the industrial sector of\\nthe economy. By ignoring materials, we assume that\\nthey can be aggregated together with energy in theenergy input.\\nAs/H9268→1a n d /H9253→0 we have the Solow model as a\\nspecial case, where in the steady state, KandYgrow\\nat the rate of labor augmentation. Additionally, de-\\npending on the scarcity of energy, the model displays\\neither Solow-style or energy constrained behavior.\\n90\\nFor a given elasticity of substitution, when energy\\nis superabundant the steady-state level of the cap-\\nital stock and output are determined (apart froma scaling factor) by the same functions of the same\\nfactors—the savings rate, the level of labor augment-\\ning technology, and the rate of depreciation as the\\nSolow model. But when energy is relatively scarce\\nthe steady state depends on the level of energy sup-ply and the level of energy-augmenting technology.\\nTherefore, in the preindustrial era when energy was\\nscarce due to the limited supply of land, the steady-state level of output was determined by the supply of\\nenergy and the level of energy augmentation. After\\nthe industrial revolution, as energy became moreand more abundant, the long-run behavior of the\\nmodel economy becomes more and more like the\\nSolow model where the growth of output is deter-mined by the rate of labor augmentation. Addition-\\nally, if the cost share of energy falls over time more\\nwork effort can be directed to ﬁnal output, boostingthe growth rate of GDP per hour worked. Similarly,\\nAyres and Warr argue that historical declines in en-\\nergy prices have been a major driver of economic\\ngrowth.\\n48\\nWhy assume that the elasticity of substitution be-\\ntween energy and capital-labor is less than unity?\\nAfter all, if the energy supply is constant, then en-\\nergy will act as a constraint on growth in the sameway that a ﬁxed land supply constrains growth in the\\nMalthusian sector of Hansen and Prescott’s model.First, the cost share of energy in Sweden, a country\\nfor which we have data from 1800 till the present,\\nfell over time (Fig. 3). This is not possible for a singlesector Cobb–Douglas technology. The extent of the\\nfall from a ratio of 90% of GDP (50% of gross out-\\nput) in 1800 to close to 10% of GDP today appearsto rule out structural change as the explanation ei-\\nther. Second, we cannot distinguish between labor\\naugmenting innovations and energy augmenting in-\\nnovations in a Cobb–Douglas technology. Using a\\nCES production function allows us to distinguishbetween labor and energy augmenting technical\\nchange. Fr ¨oling develops a uniﬁed energy-growth\\nmodel that allows the separate augmentation of en-ergy in the production of energy services but it is as-\\nsumed that total factor productivity (TFP) growth\\naugments energy services, labor, and land in ﬁnalproduction at the same rate.\\n91Furthermore, be-\\ncause ﬁnal output is produced by a Cobb–Douglas\\nfunction, the model cannot reproduce the declinein the energy cost share. Similarly, Tahvonen and\\nSalo\\n67develop a model of energy transitions be-\\ntween renewable and nonrenewable energy sourcesin the long run. They also assume that ﬁnal out-\\nput is produced by a Cobb–Douglas function and\\nthat there is technical progress in the extraction of\\nfossil fuels (but not in the production of ﬁnal\\noutput).\\nThird, the ecological economics literature and\\neconometric results discussed earlier indicate that\\nthe elasticity of substitution between capital andenergy is less than unity. The production function\\nin Equation (1) has two limits to substitution.\\n9The\\n“microeconomic” limit to substitution results from/H9268<1 so that a minimum quantity of energy is\\nrequired to produce any given level of output and\\nenergy is essential to production. The “macroeco-nomic” limit to substitution results from energy be-\\ning required to produce capital and as long as /H9254>0,\\ndepreciation means that maintenance of the capitalstock requires an ongoing energy input.\\nIf this model is a reasonable representation of re-\\nality, then mainstream economists are not wrong\\nto ignore the role of energy in economic growth\\nin developed economies where energy is abundantbut their models have limited applicability to other\\nsituations. However, in the long run, even if there\\nis labor augmenting technical change, energy sup-ply or energy efﬁciency must also be increasing\\nor eventually energy will again begin to constrain\\nAnn.

Preliminary research results show\\nthat this model can simulate the observed features\\nof the Swedish economy in the last two centuries\\nreasonably well, including the fall in the cost shareof energy and the decline in energy intensity over\\ntime.\\n90\\nAyres and Warr also developed an approach that\\nseeks to explain the role of energy in long-run eco-\\nnomic growth while containing some elements of\\nmainstream models.48,49Capital, labor, and useful\\nwork performed by energy combine in a continuous\\n“LINEX” production function. In the REXS growthmodel,\\n92capital accumulates as in the Solow growth\\nmodel. But, in contrast to mainstream models, tech-\\nnological change only acts to raise the ratio of use-ful work performed per joule of exergy, as there is\\nno labor augmentation or factor neutral technical\\nchange. Output elasticities are not constrained toequal cost shares and the LINEX production func-\\ntion assumes that as capital accumulates and the\\neconomy becomes “more automated” the outputelasticity of labor falls.\\n93Also labor and energy are\\nassumed to be q-substitutes—increases in energy\\nuse reduce the marginal product of labor, which canbecome negative when energy is very abundant. As\\na result, the output elasticity of labor falls over time\\nand the role of energy grows. This is in contrast to mymodel where, as energy use increases, the economy\\nis better represented by the Solow growth model,\\noutput elasticities are assumed to be equal to cost\\nshares, all inputs are q-complements—increases ineach input increase the marginal products of the\\nother inputs—and technical change can augment\\nboth labor and energy.\\nFactors affecting the linkage between\\nenergy and growth\\nIntroduction\\nSo far, we have established that energy is an essentialinput, that in theory in the long-run energy avail-\\nability could constrain economic growth, and thatthe current relative abundance of energy sources\\nhas alleviated these constraints.

Even Ain Equation\\n(3) is just general TFP and, therefore, includes the\\neffects of technological change on augmenting other\\ninputs as well as energy. There are several ways of\\nmeasuring the level of technology that control forthese other factors.

The functions\\nin Equation (4) can be estimated econometrically5\\nor nonparametrically.\\nAn alternative approach is an index of energy\\naugmenting technical change.

With some excep-\\ntions, the general trend over the 20th century in the\\nUnited States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Austriahas been to greater energy efﬁciency measured in\\nthis way. Over shorter periods energy efﬁciency has\\ndeclined in some countries as it has in the long termfor some fuels, especially food and feed.\\nEstimates of the trend in AEEI, energy efﬁciency,\\nor the energy augmentation index are mixed.\\n109The\\ndirection of change has not been constant and varies\\nacross different sectors of the economy. Berndt et al.\\nuse a model with linear time trends to estimate aug-\\nmentation trends labor, electricity, fuels, machines,\\nand structures in the U.S. manufacturing industrybetween 1965 and 1987.\\n110The rates of augmenta-\\ntion were 11.8% and –3.4% per annum for electric-\\nity and fuels, respectively. Patterns for Canada andFrance were, however, entirely different.\\nJudson et al . estimate separate models for en-\\nergy consumption in each of a number of energy-consuming sectors for a large panel of data.\\n111They\\nestimate time effects that show rising energy con-\\nsumption over time in the household and other sec-tors but ﬂat to declining time effects in industry and\\nconstruction.

Con-\\nsumers are constrained by a ﬁxed nominal income,\\nbut producers’ costs are not similarly constrained.\\nTherefore, output effects can be large. For example,Darwin found that for wood-saving technological\\nchange in the U.S. Paciﬁc Northwest output effects\\nwere sufﬁciently large as to increase the consump-tion of raw logs.\\n127\\nIn partial equilibrium, the absolute value of the\\ndemand elasticity for energy should be an upperlimit on the size of the rebound effect.\\n128Brookes\\nsuggested that, due to long-run growth effects, the\\nrebound effect could be larger than the initial savingresulting in higher, not lower, energy consumption,\\nor “backﬁre” (also known as “Jevon’s paradox”).\\n129\\nUsing a macro model with ﬁxed energy prices, Saun-\\nders showed that this required that the elasticity\\nof substitution between energy and other inputs is\\ne q u a lt oo rg r e a t e rt h a nu n i t y ,w h i c ha sw eh a v eseen is unlikely.\\n130Howarth, however, argues per-suasively that even if the elasticity of substitution is\\none or greater that, when a distinction is made be-\\ntween energy services and energy use, the macrolevelenergy rebound effect for a production innovation\\nis less than the initial innovation-induced reduction\\nin energy use, so improvements in energy efﬁciencydo, in fact, reduce total energy demand.\\n126However,\\nbackﬁre might be possible if the share of energy costs\\nin total output was large and the share of energy costs\\nin energy services was high.

The evolution of the energy mixover the course of economic development and over\\nhistory in the technologically leading countries de-\\npends on each country’s endowments of fossil en-ergy and potential for renewables, such as hydro-\\nelectricity, but some regularities apply. The share\\nof electricity in total energy use tends to rise. Low-income countries tend to generate electricity from\\nhydropower and oil, while high-income countries\\nhave more diverse power sources including nuclearpower. Direct use of coal tends to rise and then\\nfall over time and with income. Natural gas use has\\nincreased signiﬁcantly in recent decades mostly in\\nmore developed economies. Finally electricity gen-\\nerated from solar and wind power are only nowbeginning to take off in more developed economies.\\nFigure 1 illustrates this pattern for the United States.\\nEnergy quality is the relative economic useful-\\nness per heat equivalent unit of different fuels and\\nelectricity. Fuels have a number of physical at-\\ntributes that will affect their relative qualities, in-cluding energy density; power density (rate of heat\\nunits produced per unit are per unit time); ease\\nof distribution; the need for a transfer medium;controllability; amenability to storage; safety; and\\nenvironmental impacts.\\n142–144Some fuels can be\\nused for a larger number of activities and/or formore valuable activities. Some fuels, in particular\\nelectricity, require innovations that allowed their\\nuse that must be embodied in capital equipmentcan transform the workplace entirely and changework processes, thus contributing to productivity\\ngains.\\n1,145,146\\nStern discusses alternative ways of measuring en-\\nergy quality.146The most relevant approach to un-\\nderstanding the impact of relatively small changes\\nin the composition of the energy input on economicoutput is the marginal product of the fuel. This is\\ndetermined in part by the complex set of attributes\\ndescribed earlier that are unique to each fuel. It also\\nvaries according to what activities it is used in, how\\nmuch and what form of capital, labor, and materialsit is used in conjunction with, and how much energy\\nis used in each application. More abundant fuels will\\nbe applied more widely and on the margin in lessproductive applications.\\n147Therefore, energy qual-\\nities measured in this way are not ﬁxed over time.\\nHowever, it is generally believed that electricity is thehighest quality type of energy followed by natural\\ngas, oil, coal, and wood and biofuels in descend-\\ning order of quality. This is supported by the typicalprices of these fuels per unit of energy, which should\\nbe proportional to their marginal products. Under\\nthe assumption of optimizing behavior, marginalproducts should be approximated by prices, which\\nare usually readily available. Other indicators of en-\\nergy quality must be estimated. As energy vectors\\ndiffer in quality, shifts in the energy mix should af-\\nfect energy intensity.\\nSurprisingly, relatively few studies evaluate the\\nrole of the change in energy mix on energy in-\\ntensity. Noting that the composition of energy usehas changed signiﬁcantly over time, Schurr and\\nNetschert were among the ﬁrst to argue that the gen-\\neral shift to higher quality fuels reduces the amountof energy required to produce a dollar’s worth of\\nGDP .\\n148Berndt also noted the key role played by the\\nshifting composition of energy use toward higherquality energy inputs.\\n112\\nCleveland et al.,45Kaufmann,78,106and the Ofﬁce\\nof T echnology Assessment149presented analyses that\\nexplain much of the decline in the U.S. energy/GDP\\nratio in terms of structural shifts in the economy and\\nshifts from lower to higher quality fuels.

Inparticular, exhaustion of low-cost oil supplies could\\nmean that economies have to revert to lower quality\\nfuels, such as coal.\\n78\\nFigure 4 also includes a quality-adjusted index of\\nﬁnal energy use that accounts for differences in the\\nproductivity of different fuels by weighting them by\\ntheir prices.150There is less evidence of decoupling\\nof energy use and GDP in these data than indicatedby the primary energy series. The studies cited ear-\\nlier (and those by Stern discussed later\\n150,151) used\\nearlier GDP data that showed signiﬁcantly less eco-nomic growth in the United States than more re-\\ncently updated data do. Using these earlier data there\\nwas little decoupling of GDP from quality-adjustedenergy use even after 1973. This change in the GDP\\ndata indicates that structural change and techno-\\nlogical change must also contribute to lowering theenergy/GDP ratio in the last three decades assuming\\nthat prices reﬂect the relative marginal products of\\nthe fuels.\\nOther studies ﬁnd, however, a much larger role\\nfor technological change than for changes in the\\ncomposition of energy in the reductions in en-\\nergy intensity seen around the world. For exam-\\nple, Ma and Stern ﬁnd that interfuel substitutionhas negligible effects on the decline in energy in-\\ntensity in China between 1994 and 2003.\\n152Te ch -\\nnological change reduced energy intensity by morethan the actual reduction in energy intensity due to\\nthe intensity increasing effects of structural change.\\nStern ﬁnds that between 1971 and 2007, changesin fuel mix within individual countries increased\\nworld energy use by 4%, while global energy in-\\ntensity declined by 40%. Shifts in the distributionof economic activity toward countries with lower\\nquality energy mixes, such as China and India,\\ncontributed further to increasing energy intensityglobally.\\n5\\nShifts in the composition of output\\nOutput mix also typically changes over the course\\nof economic development. In the earlier phases of\\ndevelopment there is a shift away from agriculturetoward heavy industry, while in the later stages of\\ndevelopment there is a shift from the more resource-\\nintensive extractive and heavy industrial sectors to-ward services and lighter manufacturing. Differentindustries have different energy intensities. It is of-\\nten argued that this will result in an increase in\\nenergy used per unit of output in the early stages ofeconomic development and a reduction in energy\\nused per unit output in the later stages of economic\\ndevelopment.\\n153\\nHowever, there is reason to believe that the\\nenergy-saving effects of structural changes are over-\\nstated. When the indirect energy use, embodied in\\nmanufactured products and services, is taken into\\naccount, the U.S. service and household sectors aremore energy intensive than they ﬁrst appear.\\n44Ser-\\nvice industries still need large energy and resource\\ninputs. The service being sold may be intangiblebut the ofﬁce towers, shopping malls, warehouses,\\nrental apartment complexes, etc., where the activity\\nis conducted are very tangible and energy is usedin their construction, operation, and maintenance.\\nFurthermore, consumers use large amounts of en-\\nergy and resources in commuting to work, shop,etc.\\nThe effect of the Internet on the energy intensity\\nof commerce has received increasing attention.\\n154\\nObviously, individual technologies such as news\\nwebsites versus newspapers can greatly reduce emis-\\nsions155but the effects on other activities could\\noutweigh the gains.

An-other key characteristic that distinguishes between\\nstudies is whether a bivariate model of energy and\\noutput or a multivariate framework is used. A thirdway to differentiate among models is whether en-\\nergy is measured in standard heat units or whether\\nsome type of indexing method is used to accountfor differences in quality among fuels.\\nIt is now understood that in the absence of coin-\\ntegration between the variables a Granger causal-ity test on a V AR in levels is invalid. Ohanian\\n170and T oda and Phillips171showed that the distribu-\\ntion of the test statistic for Granger causality in a\\nV AR with nonstationary variables is not the stan-dard chi-square distribution. This means that the\\nsigniﬁcance levels reported in the early studies of\\nthe Granger-causality relationship between energyand GDP may be incorrect, as both variables are gen-\\nerally integrated series. If there is no cointegration\\nbetween the variables then the causality test should\\nbe carried out on a V AR in differenced data, while if\\nthere is cointegration, standard chi-square distribu-tions apply when the cointegrating restrictions are\\nimposed.\\n172T oda and Y amamoto developed a modi-\\nﬁcation of the standard Granger causality test on thevariables in levels that are robust to the presence of\\nunit roots.\\n172But it is still, of course, subject to pos-\\nsible omitted variables bias. Cointegration tests canbe used to test for omitted nonstationary variables.\\nA lack of cointegration implies that variables essen-\\ntial to cointegration are omitted from the model.Therefore, testing for cointegration is still a neces-\\nsary prerequisite to causality testing on data with\\npotential unit roots.\\nThe results of the early studies that tested for\\nGranger causality using a bivariate model were gen-\\nerally inconclusive.\\n151Where nominally signiﬁcant\\nresults were obtained, they mostly indicated that\\ncausality runs from output to energy. However,in many cases results differed depending on the\\nsamples used, the countries investigated, etc. Most\\neconomists believe that capital, labor, and technicalchange play a signiﬁcant role in determining output,\\nyet early studies used only energy as an independent\\nvariable. When relevant variables are omitted fromthe model, there will be no cointegration and a spu-\\nrious regression will result.

However, as the short-run elasticity of de-mand for oil and other forms of energy is low, the\\nmain short-run effects of oil prices are expected to\\nbe through reducing spending by consumers andﬁrms on other goods, services, and inputs rather\\nthan through reducing the input of energy to pro-\\nduction.\\n3,177Therefore, models using oil prices in\\nplace of energy quantities may not provide much\\nevidence regarding the effects of energy use itself on\\neconomic growth.\\nYu and Jin conducted the ﬁrst cointegration study\\nof the energy–GDP relationship.178Again, the re-\\nsults of this and subsequent studies differ accordingto the regions, time frames, and measures of inputs\\nand outputs used. If a multivariate approach helps in\\nuncovering the Granger causality relations between\\nenergy and GDP , a multivariate approach should\\nbe used to investigate the cointegration relationsamong the variables. When multivariate cointegra-\\ntion methods are used, a picture emerges of energy\\nplaying a central role in determining output in a di-verse set of developed and developing nations.

Warr and Ayres replicate thismodel for the United States using their measures\\nof exergy and useful work in place of Stern’s Di-\\nvisia index of energy use.\\n179They ﬁnd both short-\\nand long-run causality from either exergy or use-\\nful work to GDP but not vice versa.

Lee and Chang\\n182\\nﬁnd a long-run causal relationship from energy to\\nGDP in the group of Asian countries while Lee et\\nal.183ﬁnd a bidirectional relationship in the OECD\\nsample. Taken together, this body of work suggests\\nthat the inconclusive results of earlier work are prob-\\nably due to the omission of nonenergy inputs. How-ever, using a panel vector error correction model of\\nGDP , energy use, and energy prices for 26 OECD\\ncountries (1978–2005), Costantini and Martini ﬁndthat in the short run energy prices cause GDP and\\nenergy use, and energy use and GDP are mutu-\\nally causative.\\n184However, in the long run they\\nﬁnd that GDP growth drives energy use and en-\\nergy prices. Other researchers who model a coin-\\ntegrating relation between GDP , energy, and en-ergy prices for individual countries produce mixed\\nresults. For example, Glasure\\n185ﬁnds very similar\\nresults to Costantini and Martini for Korea, whileMasih and Masih\\n186and Hondroyiannis et al .187\\nﬁnd mutual causation in the long run for Korea\\nand Taiwan and Greece, respectively. Using an idea\\nfrom meta-analysis,188we should probably put most\\nweight on the largest sample study—that is, Costan-tini and Martini\\n184—concluding that these models\\nidentify a demand function relationship where in\\nthe long run GDP growth drives energy use.\\nConclusions\\nIn conclusion, the theoretical and empirical ev-\\nidence indicates that energy use and output are\\ntightly coupled with energy availability playing a\\nkey role in enabling growth. However, the greateravailability of energy, technical progress, and the\\nemployment of higher quality fuels have allowed\\nless energy to be used per unit output and have re-duced the constraint that energy resources place on\\nthe output of the economy and economic growth.\\nEven so, energy remains important.\\nEnergy is important for growth because produc-\\ntion is a function of capital, labor, and energy, not\\njust the former two or just the latter as main-stream growth models or some biophysical pro-\\nduction models taken literally would indicate.

In fact, energy-saving technical progress in\\nmanufacturing industry that reduces the apparent\\nshare of manufacturing in the economy may bemore important.\\n163\\nAs this survey shows, there is clearly much scope\\nfor further research to clarify the prospects for de-coupling energy use and economic growth and for\\nunderstanding the role of energy in growth.\\nAcknowledgments\\nI thank Jeroen van den Bergh, Cutler Cleveland,\\nAstrid Kander, Cameron Murray, Catherine Nor-\\nman, Jack Pezzey, Mark Diesendorf, Robert Ayres,\\nand two anonymous referees for useful commentsand discussions on various versions of this paper.\\nConﬂicts of interest\\nThe author declares no conﬂicts of interest.References\\n1.

Innovations \\nin this area are adapted at tremendous speed and worldwide \\nuse of ICT has soared in recent years. However, this \\nunprecedented growth comes at a price: ICT systems are meanwhile responsible for the same amount of CO\\n2 emissions \\nas global air travel. If the growth of ICT systems energy \\nconsumption continues at the present pace, it will endanger ambitious plans to reduce CO\\n2 emissions and tackle climate \\nchange. Increasing the energy e fficiency of ICT systems is \\nthus clearly the major R&D challe nge in the decades to come.  \\n \\nI. ICT  MARKET TRENDS  \\nRarely have technical innovations changed everyday life as \\nfast and profoundly as the ma ssive use of the Internet and \\nintroduction of personal mobile communications. In the past \\ntwo decades both grew from niche market applications to globally available components of daily life: The first GSM \\nphone call took place 1991 in Finland – only 15 years later \\nthere were over 2 billion GSM us ers [1]. In November 2007, \\nevery second inhabitant of this planet possessed a mobile \\ntelephone [2]. In the same time span, the number of internet \\nservers rose by roughly a factor of 1000: from 376’000 to 395 million [3]. The driving force behind these two developments \\nwas, and continues to be, \"Moore\\'s Law\" (or rather the ITRS \\nroadmap), according to which bo th the processing power of \\nCPUs and the capacity of mass storage devices doubles \\napproximately every 18 months. This in turn renders the use of ever more powerful ICT systems attractive for the mass \\nmarket. In order to be able to transport this exponentially \\nrising amount of available data to the user in an acceptable time, the data transmission rates both in the (wired) internet \\nand wireless networks (including cellular, WLAN and \\nWPAN) have been rising at th e same speed – by about a \\nfactor 10 every 5 years, as illustrated in Figure 1.  \\nMany achievements of information society are based on the \\nglobal success of information technology which has been \\nmade possible by innovations in microelectronics. In the last \\nyears, ICT systems have been responsible for the enormous \\neconomic boom not only of former developing countries like Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, they have also been the \\nsource of at least a fourth of the BIP growth of developed \\nnations like the United States [4] and the European Union [5]. Instead of opening up a \"digital  divide\" between the first and \\nthe third world, the use of ICT has so far lead to the opposite.  \\nII. ICT\\n ENERGY CONSUMPTION TRENDS  \\nThe price paid for this enormous growth in data rates and \\nmarket penetration is a rising power requirement of ICT \\nsystems – although at a substantially lower speed than \"Moore\\'s Law\".  \\n \\nBoth in server farms as core un its of the internet [6], as well \\nas in mobile communications systems [7], a rise of the power consumption of 16-20% per year can be observed in the last \\nyears, corresponding to a d oubling every 4-5 years, as \\nillustrated by Figures 2 and 3. As result of this development, server farms meanwhile consume approximately 180 billion \\nkWh of electricity per year – over 1% of the world-wide \\nelectricity consumption\\n1. This corresponds to the typical \\nyearly electricity consumption of 60 million households – \\nover a third of the number of households in the EU. \\n                                                           \\n1 Based on the data from [6] and a 20% increase for 2006 and \\n2007.

A ten-fold increase can be observed every five \\nyears, coinciding with th e speed of “Moore’s Law” Figure 1: Increase in power consumption of Vodafone’s \\nradio access network over the past years [7]. The 11th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC 2008) \\nAccording to a study by ABI research, the base stations and \\nbackhaul networks of the cellular communications networks \\noperators consume approximately 60 billion kWh per year [9], corresponding to roughly 0.33% of global electricity \\nconsumption [8]. Similar figures have been reported in a \\nWhite Paper of Ericsson [18], which estimates that mobile \\nnetworks are responsible for 0.12% of primary energy use \\n(electricity typically makes up for roughly one third of \\nprimary energy use). The base stations themselves often have a share of over 80% of the electricity consumed by an \\noperator’s mobile network [7]. Server farms and cellular \\nnetworks taken together consume as much electricity as \\nproduced by 27 power stations with an output of 1 Gigawatt \\neach, or nearly 10% of the elect ricity produced by nuclear \\npower stations world wide in 2005 [8]. This is equivalent to \\nCO\\n2 emissions of approximately 130 millions tons per year, \\ncomparable with the CO 2 emissions caused by the whole of \\nBelgium [10]. However, in 2005 \"only\" 27 millions server \\nnodes were located in server farms – compared to over 300 \\nmillion host in the entire internet (today there are nearly 500 Mio [3]). The total amount of electricity consumed by the \\ninternet (including all routers, switches, etc.) will thus \\nactually lie far above that of the server farms alone.  \\n \\nIf one sums up the energy consumed by the infrastructure of \\ncellular wireless networks, wired communications (PSTN) \\nnetworks, and the internet (outside of and within the server farms), a portion of 3% of the world-wide electric power \\nconsumptions appears to be a conservative estimate.  \\nBut this percentage is still relatively low compared with the quantity of electricity consumed by ICT systems in private \\nhouseholds and offices of enterprises, in particular by laptops, \\ndesktop PCs and displays/monitors. In Germany, the power consumption of ICT systems added up to 38 billion kWh \\nalready in 2001 – 8% of the total electricity consumption \\n[11]. Due to the strong growth of market penetration and \\npower consumption of ICT systems, this value might \\nmeanwhile lie beyond 10%, as is confirmed by recent studies from the UK [12].  III. E\\nNVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETY IMPACT  \\nThe immense influence ICT sy stems on the power supply \\nsituation can by read from the following 3 facts:  \\n• Currently, server farms and telecommunications \\ninfrastructure are responsible for roughly 3% of the \\nworld wide electricity consumption. If the present growth trend of 16% per year continues, as the \\nincrease of internet traffic\\n2 and the number of mobile \\nphone subscribers suggests3, this consumption rises \\nby a factor of 30 in only 23 years: the current level \\nof world electricity consumption. The doubling of consumption predicted by the WEC for 2050 [15] \\nwould thus be reached already 20 years earlier, in \\n2030, due to server farm s and telecommunications \\ninfrastructure alone. \\n• 10% of the electricity consumption of North \\nAmerica, Western Europe and Japan corresponds to roughly 900 billion kWh per year, equivalent to the \\namount of electric power produced in the whole of \\nCentral and South America\\n4. To spread the \\n“information technology standard of living” of the \\nmentioned countries over the whole world would \\nalready today require 40% of the globally installed electrical power generation capability. In less than \\n10 years, the entire ex isting power generation \\ncapacity would not be sufficient for this task\\n5. The \\npower supply problem alone would thus lead to the \\nopening of a \"digital divide\" between developing \\ncountries and the developed world. Already today, \\nmore than two thirds of the operational expenses in \\ncellular networks in India are due to the buying of diesel for running the generators of the cellular base \\nstations. Cellular network operators spend beyond \\n200 Mio. Euros each year for their electricity bills in \\nGermany alone. Electricity  has grown to a cost \\nfactor comparable to the total wages of the engineers \\nwho keep the network running. \\n• According to a study by Gartner research [16], ICT \\nsystems cause 2% of global CO\\n2 emissions already \\ntoday, corresponding to  \\no 2/3 of the CO 2 emissions of Germany [10] \\no the total CO 2 emissions caused by the \\ninternational air traffic [16] \\no 1/4 of the CO 2 emissions produced by \\npassenger cars world-wide [17] \\n \\n                                                           \\n2 A 40% annual growth in IP traffic is predicted in [13] and \\nby Cisco’s Global IP traffic forecast [19] \\n3 8 million subscribers are added/month in India alone [14] \\n4 North America, Western Europe and Japan produced 8\\'600 \\nbillion kWh of electrical energy in 2005, Central and South \\nAmerica produced 909 billion kWh [8] \\n5 Assuming a 16% growth of the 3% of electrical power \\nconsumption due to server farms and  telecommunications \\ninfrastructure; the above mentioned countries correspond to roughly 13% of the world’ population; a percentage figure \\nwhich is obviously bound to shrink 020406080100120140\\n2000 2005TWh/year\\n020406080100120140\\n2000 2005TWh/year\\nUS Western Europe Asia Pacific RoWWorld\\'s server electricity \\nconsumption\\n(incl. cooling)\\nFigure 3: Increase in power consumption of data centers [6].The 11th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC 2008) \\nIV. RESEARCH CHALLENGES AND SOLUTION APPROACHES  \\nICT systems are the key to the innovation capability and thus \\nthe economic success of developed and developing nations. New challenges arise due to the drastic increase in data rates \\nand processing power of ICT systems, which require a \\nmassive research effort into the energy efficiency of ICT \\nsystems. To cite Viviane Reding: \"To meet Europe\\'s energy \\nefficiency goals by 2020, we need a high growth, low carbon \\neconomy. Research and rapid take-up of innovative energy efficient ICT solutions will be crucial […] There is a win-win \\nsituation in which ICT will promote the competitiveness of \\nEU industry while leading the fight against climate change\". \\nA study by the McKinsey Global Institute found that „The \\neconomics of investing in energy productivity […] are very attractive. With an average internal rate  of return of 17%, \\nsuch investments would generate energy savings ramping up \\nto $900 billion annually by 2020“. Research into energy efficient wireless networks is thus not only ecologically, but \\nalso economically very relevant. \\nRelevant research areas for the next years include: \\n• The use of high temperature electronics and \\nalternative energy backup solutions, instead of \\nbatteries. Thus, the energy overhead due to air conditioning can be avoided, which takes up a \\nsignificant part of the overall energy consumption in \\nserver farms and cellular base stations [6]. \\n• Energy aware strategies for distributed computing \\nand data storage (distributed data centers), to enable \\nnext generation peer-to-peer and content distribution \\nservices at minimum energy cost. \\n• Adaptive power management based on current traffic \\n/ system load in all areas of ICT systems, e.g.: \\no In the radio access network, to reduce the \\npower invested in “pilot pollution” in empty cells, under the condition of not \\ncompromising on coverage. \\no In data centers using massively parallel \\ncomputing, which currently often run at full \\nperformance, even at low system load. \\no In electronic devices for \\ntelecommunications, such as complex \\nsystems-on-chip. \\n• New network architectures based on high density \\nlow transmit power microcells and relaying as \\nopposed to low density, high transmit power, macro cells. The key here is to find a suitable trade-off \\nbetween the power consumption analog and digital \\nhardware blocks. \\n• Highly efficient power amplifiers for transmit \\nsignals with large peak -to-average-power ratio. \\n• Programmable, application specific, highly parallel, \\npower efficient digital baseband processors, which \\non the one hand allow for higher flexibility than \\nASIC hardware accelerators,  and on the other hand \\nconsume much less power per function than “general \\npurpose” DSPs and FPGAs. \\n• Physical and MAC layer optimized for maximum \\nenergy efficiency, also making use of cross-layer optimization. Spatially, temporally and spectrally \\nlocalized transmission strategies which minimize the \\nenergy spent to transmit a single information bit will be crucial to achieve high  energy efficiency. This \\nspeaks very much in favour of OFDM-based \\nPHY/MAC schemes (LTE and beyond) as opposed to spread spectrum techniques (3G). \\n• The development of suitable utility functions, which \\nenable to solve the multi-criteria optimization \\nproblems arising from the inclusion of energy \\nefficiency beyond spectral efficiency and coverage \\nas optimization criteria in an efficient and \\ntransparent way. \\n Only by finding solutions to these challenging questions can a \\ncontinuing growth of ICT be made ecologically – and \\neconomically – sustainable. T ackling these challenges will \\nalso allow for a shift in paradigms in how cellular networks \\noperate. Reducing the power consumption of base stations \\ndown to few tens of Watts will enable to build base stations which can be powered solely based on renewable energy \\nsources like solar and wind power. Together with wireless \\nbackhaul (e.g. based on microwave links), these sites will be \\nextremely easy to deploy. This will again help to narrow the \\ndigital divide between developed and developing nations, \\nwhere access to energy and tel ecommunications infrastructure \\nis often a limiting factor. \\n \\nImproving the energy e fficiency of ICT components up to the \\nlevel where energy autarchy can be reached is also crucial for \\na relatively young, but rapidly growing, sector of the ICT industry: sensor networks. Ridding sensor nodes of the need \\nof a wired interconnect and the lifetime and form factor \\nlimitations which a battery powered device has to accept is a key enabler for a massive deployment of sensor networks. \\nSuch “smart dust” may then be used in applications in which \\nthe stated limitations so far prevented the massive use of sensor nodes: for example in structure surveillance of \\nbuildings, bridges, industrial facilities and carbon/fiber \\nreinforced composite materials used in modern planes and cars or in machine and facility surveillance in industry. Thus, \\nthe WWRF vision of a thousand wireless devices serving \\neach human being by 2017 can be realized. \\nV. I\\nMPACT ON OTHER SECTORS OF ECONOMY  \\nThe solutions developed for incr easing the energy efficiency \\nof ICT will provide new tools, technologies and insights which can – and should – also be used for further \\napplications. Low power microe lectronics can for example \\nhelp building cars that produce less CO\\n2 per km: already \\ntoday, 20% of the value creation in modern automotive \\nindustry is based on car electronics. It is expected, that this percentage grows to 40% by 2015. If energy efficiency is not \\nimproved, gasoline consumption due to car electronics will \\nrise accordingly – from 0.5 l / km today to more than 1 l / km. \\nCar manufacturing and industry automation thus constitute \\nthe logical next steps to appl y energy efficiency paradigms \\nlearned in ICT to other sectors of economy.

Introduction\\nEnergy is required to sustain and improve quality of life.\\nThe dramatic societal changes and the six-fold population growth\\nsince the industrial revolution have required vast amounts ofenergy provided mainly by coal and petroleum ( Hall et al., 2003 ).\\nIn the near future, further population growth and improvements\\nin quality of life will increase the demand for non-renewable\\nfossil fuels and intensify the associated environmental implica-\\ntions ( IPCC, 2007 ;Lee, 2011 ).In the meantime, the high rate of fossil fuel consumption\\naccelerates their depletion ( Bentley et al., 2007 —note: two-thirds\\nof the world’s oil-producing countries are already past their\\nproduction peak), technological readiness and economic return\\non investment hinders the development of non-conventionalfossil fuel sources ( Arent et al., 2011 ;Resch et al., 2008 ), the\\nhydroelectric capacity is almost saturated ( EIA, 2010 ), renewed\\nconcerns affects investment in nuclear energy ( Glaser, 2011 ), and\\nrenewables grow fast but starting from a small base ( REN21,\\n2011 ). In this context, improvements in efﬁciency and conserva-\\ntion must remain important components in the global energy\\nstrategy ( Herring, 2006 ).\\nOther aggravating conditions add further concerns to the\\npresent situation. The spatial mismatch between resource and\\ndemand strains international affairs ( Colgan, 2010 ). Trade balance\\nand technological differences imply disparities in energy and\\ncarbon dioxide embodied in global transactions ( Machado et al.,\\n2001 ;Peters and Hertwich, 2008 ). Finally, the contrast in the time\\nscale between the political cycle ( /C244 years), industrial invest-\\nments ( /C2440 years), and natural processes (millennia) delays\\ndetermined decision-making.Contents lists available at SciVerse ScienceDirect\\njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/enpolEnergy Policy\\n0301-4215/$ - see front matter &2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, we use the new index to trace global energy\\nconsumption trends and to explore the relationship between\\nquality of life and population growth. Finally, we anticipate future\\nenergy demands based on current trends and explore the effects\\nof various realizable scenarios.\\n2. New quality of life index in view of energy needs\\nSeveral indices, such as the human development index of the\\nUnited Nations ( UNDP, 2010 ), the human welfare index of\\nMeadows and Randers ( Meadows et al., 2004 ), and the quality\\nof life index of the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU, 2007 ) have\\nbeen proposed to compare societies and to quantify their\\nimprovements. All these indices consider income, which inher-\\nently biases the indices to show a high correlation with energy\\nconsumption, as will be discussed later on.\\n2.1. Quality of life variables\\nAn alternative quality of life indicator is explored herein in\\nterms of quantiﬁable quality of life-related variables that are not\\ndirectly determined by energy consumption. We place emphasis\\non variables that are available for most countries over several\\ndecades. Based on these considerations, we identify the following\\nfour variables:\\n/C15Improved Water Access WA [–]: Proportion of the population\\nusing improved drinking-water sources, such as public tap,\\ntube well, and protected springs ( UN, 2011b ).\\n/C15Life Expectancy at Birth LE [years]: The number of years a\\nnewborn infant would live if the mortality patterns at the time\\nof birth prevail throughout the individual’s life ( WB, 2011 ).\\n/C15Infant Mortality Rate IM [deaths/1000 live births]: The number\\nof infants that die before reaching one year of age, per 1000\\nlive births in a given year ( WB, 2011 ).\\n/C15Mean Years of Schooling MYS [years]: Lifetime number of years\\nof education received by individuals ages 25 and older ( Barro\\nand Lee, 2010 ;UN, 2011a ;WB, 2011 ).\\nTwo additional variables, electriﬁcation level and income, are\\ncompared in this section. They are deﬁned as follows:\\n/C15Electriﬁcation Level EL [–]: Proportion of the population with\\naccess to electricity ( DM, 2011 ;Elvidge et al., 2011 ;IEA, 2010 ).\\n/C15Gross National Income per Capita GNI [US$/person]: Sum of\\nvalue added by all resident producers in the economy divided\\nby the mid-year population. It is expressed in purchasing\\npower parity in US$ ( UN, 2011a ).\\nHowever, these two variables are not included in the deﬁnition\\nof the new quality of life index because they would systematically\\nbias the correlation between the index and the energy consump-\\ntion: electriﬁcation, a critical infrastructure to quality of life, is\\ninherently correlated with primary energy use, and income is the\\nmonetary dimension of energy.\\nFig. 1 shows a plot of the selected variables for 118 countries\\nversus the energy consumption rate per capita ECR [kW/person],\\nwhich is computed as the annual rate of primary energy use\\ndivided by the country’s population ( EIA, 2011 ). Primary energy\\nincludes petroleum, natural gas, coal, hydroelectricity, and renew-\\nable energy (i.e., wind, solar, and geothermal). Embodied energy infood, the direct use of biomass, and other renewable energy\\nsources, such as solar energy for heating, are not considered.\\nAlthough countries with high energy consumption rates col-\\nlapse in the ﬁgure, the logarithmic scale helps us to differentiate\\ncountries with low consumption and highlights the three orders\\nof magnitude difference between countries with low and high\\nenergy consumption.

Pasten, J.C. Santamarina / Energy Policy 49 (2012) 468–476 469with the energy consumption rate, whereas infant mortality\\ndecreases. Indices are sorted by the correlation coefﬁcient shown\\nin parentheses; the range in infant mortality and gross national\\nincome exceeds two orders of magnitude, so the correlation\\ncoefﬁcient is calculated with the logarithm of the indices.\\nTwo threshold values can be identiﬁed in the ﬁgure. First, an\\nenergy consumption rate of 1 kW/person can ensure access to\\ndrinking water and electricity, a high life expectancy, and low\\ninfant mortality. Second, consumption in excess of /C245 kW/person\\nis not needed to attain the highest values of the quality of life\\nindicators. These energy thresholds reﬂect today’s technology and\\nwill decrease with the development of new energy-oriented\\ntechnology.\\n2.2. Quality of life index\\nLet’s identify the quality of life index QLthat both combines\\nquality of life-related variables, WA,LE,IM, and MYS, and exhibits\\nthe strongest correlation with the measured energy consumption\\nrate per capita. Since consumption ranges over more than three\\norders of magnitude between countries, the sought index is the\\nbest predictor of the logarithm of the energy consumption rate.\\nLinear and factorial combinations are explored:\\nQL¼a/C2WAþb/C2LE\\nyrs/C18/C19\\nþg/C2logIM\\ndeaths =1000 born/C18/C19\\nþd/C2MYS\\nyrs/C18/C19\\nþe\\nð1Þ\\nQL¼WA/C2LE\\nyrs/C18/C19\\n/C2logIM\\ndeaths =1000 born/C18/C19\\n/C2MYS\\nyrs/C18/C19 /C20/C211=4\\nþj:\\nð2ÞThe constants a,b,g,d,e, and jare determined by error\\nminimization (note: we considered L1,L2, and LNnorms; results\\npresented here are based on the least squares L2norm).\\nFollowing Ockham’s criterion, we seek to identify the smallest\\nvariable set without compromising predictability. The linear\\ncombination of life expectancy LEand mean years of schooling\\nMYS correlates with the logarithm of the measured energy\\nconsumption rate per capita almost as highly as any other\\ncombination of the four variables (in part due to correlations\\namong the variables). Due to simplicity and historical data\\navailability, these two variables are adopted to deﬁne the new\\nquality of life index\\nQL¼0:072LE\\nyrs/C18/C19\\nþ0:310MYS\\nyrs/C18/C19\\n/C02:16: ð3Þ\\nThe coefﬁcients are adopted such that the maximum quality of\\nlife index QLmax¼10 corresponds to a life expectancy LEmax¼100\\nyears and mean years of schooling MYS max¼16 years, and the\\nminimum quality of life index QLmin¼0 corresponds to LEmin¼30\\nyears and MYS min¼0 years (note that this quality of life index can\\nbe computed for an individual or group). The best and worst life\\nexpectancy and education statistics can be used to estimate the\\nmaximum and minimum quality of life attained in 2010:\\nLEmax¼83.2 years (Japan) and MYS max¼12.6 years (Norway) give\\nQLmax¼7.7, whereas LEmin¼44.6 years (Afghanistan) and\\nMYS min¼1.2 years (Mozambique) combine to produce QLmin¼1.4.\\n2.3.

For a given consumption, Eq. (3) suggests\\nthat a 4.3 year increase in life expectancy requires the same increase\\nin energy consumption as an additional year of schooling.\\nHistograms in the ﬁgure show two groups. The ﬁrst group of\\n30 countries with low energy consumption rates between 0.03\\nand 0.3 kW/person corresponds mainly to African and Asian\\ncountries; their QLindex ranges between 1.5 and 4.0. The second\\ngroup of 62 countries between 1 and 11 kW/person includes Latin\\nAmerican countries in the lower end, and European and North\\nAmerican countries towards the upper end; their QLindex ranges\\nbetween 4.0 and 7.5.\\nFig. 2 includes the mean plus-and-minus one standard deviation\\ntrends. Countries that plot below the mean minus one standard\\ndeviation exhibit particularly inefﬁcient energy use from a quality\\nof life perspective. This group includes high-energy-consumption\\ncountries, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, Libya, Belarus, Iran, and\\nSouth Africa, and low-energy-consumption countries, such as\\nZimbabwe, Yemen, Angola, and Mozambique. In contrast, countries\\nthat plot above the mean plus one standard deviation reﬂect their\\nability to attain high quality of life standards for a given energy\\nconsumption rate. This group includes Israel and the Czech Repub-\\nlic (both with QL47), and Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Peru, Cuba,\\nand Georgia (all with ECRo1.2 kW/person).\\nCurrently, 15% of the world’s population consumes more than\\n5 kW/person and accounts for 49% of the world’s total energy\\nconsumption. This excess consumption above that needed to\\nattain the highest levels of quality of life reﬂects prevailing\\nlifestyles and cultural patterns. In contrast, 6% of the world’s\\npopulation lives under very precarious conditions and without\\nbasic services, consuming less than 100 W/person (equivalent to a\\nhealthy diet of 2000 kcal/day). These people rely on hunting,agriculture, and wood for fuel and construction, all of which are\\nsustained by solar energy and natural processes.\\n3. Historical trends – analysis\\nThe quality of life index computed with Eq. (3), using data\\navailable for several decades, allows us to assess global trends andto trace the evolution of selected countries. The mean trends for\\n1980 and 2010 plotted in Fig. 3 show a global increase in quality\\nof life of about\\nDQL¼1.2; this is the compounded effect of a\\n7 years increase in life expectancy and 2.5 years increase in mean\\nyears of schooling. Several countries have followed more decisive\\ngrowth than the global trend. Complex trajectories in Fig. 3\\ntypically reﬂect political conﬂicts and social turmoil experienced\\nduring this 30-year period. For example, the civil war in Rwanda\\nfrom 1990 to 1994 corresponds to a sharp decrease in its\\nQLindex.\\n3.1. Energy efﬁcient growth\\nThe increase in the quality of life index DQLnormalized by the\\nchange in energy consumption rate DECR [kW/person] is a\\nmeasure of life-oriented energy efﬁcient growth. Based on this\\nconcept, the efﬁciency angle ais deﬁned as\\na¼tan/C01 DQL\\nDECR =kW =pers/C0/C1\"#\\n: ð4Þ\\nAn increase in quality of life without an increase in energy\\nconsumption corresponds to a¼901. Countries with low efﬁ-\\nciency angles use more energy per capita to attain similar\\nimprovements in quality of life. Fig. 4 shows the efﬁciency angle\\ncalculated using increments of the energy consumption rate and\\nthe quality of life index in the 30-year period from 1980 to 2010.\\nValues of aare plotted versus the QLindex and energy consump-\\ntion rate in 2010. Countries with a4901, such as Mozambique,\\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Libya, Cuba, and the United\\nStates, have increased their quality of life while decreasing their\\nenergy consumption during these 30 years.\\nMathematically, the linear trend in Fig. 3 QL¼aECþbEClog\\n(ECR/[kW/person]) can be used to compute the angle as a¼tan/C01\\n(dQL/dECR); which is superimposed on Fig. 4 b. Results show that\\nthe energy required to raise the quality of life increases with the\\nenergy consumption rate per capita. In other words, a small\\nincrease in energy use in countries with low energy consumption\\ncan result in a large increase in their QLindex.\\n46810QL\\nLibyaSri LankaUSA\\nJapan\\nChinaCuba\\nMadagascar] [kW/personECR5.1 + 1.9 ⋅ log\\n] [kW/personECR3.9 + 1.8 ⋅ log\\n02\\n0.01Brazil\\nRwandaCongo Dem.India\\nECR [kW/person]0.1 1 10 100\\nFig. 3.

Population growth\\nPopulation growth rates calculated in ﬁve-year intervals PG5\\n[%] are plotted against the quality of life index corresponding to\\nthe ﬁrst year of the interval in Fig. 5 . Results show that population\\ngrowth rate is inversely correlated with the QLindex adopted in\\nthis study [Eq. (3)],\\nPG5/C2520/C02:5QL: ð5Þ\\nIn general, the evolution of the population growth rate in\\nindividual countries in the 1980–2010 period has followed the\\nglobal trend ( Fig. 5 ). For instance, Brazil, China, India, and Japan\\nhave experienced a steady decrease in population growth rate asthe quality of life increased since 1980. Several countries with a\\nlow QLindex, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\\nexperienced instability during this period and exhibited an\\ninconsistent population growth pattern. The inverse correlation\\nbetween population growth and quality of life aggravates predic-\\ntions of energy demands since a high increase in energy con-\\nsumption is expected in the developing world. Countries that\\nmanage to improve their quality of life with a constant energy\\nconsumption rate per capita (i.e.,\\na¼901) will eventually lower\\ntheir total energy consumption as their populations stabilize.\\n4. Scenarios: quality of life-centered energy consumption\\npredictions\\nPredictions of energy consumption must consider the coupling\\nbetween consumption, quality of life, and population growth.\\nGiven the time delay in data availability, we select the year 2010\\nas the base year.\\nA country’s rate of energy consumption is the product between\\nits population Pand its energy consumption rate per capita ECR;\\nthe global energy consumption rate is computed as a summation\\nfor all countries\\nECR global¼X\\nkECR k/C2Pk: ð6Þ\\nFor the base year 2010, the global energy consumption rate\\nwas ECR global¼17 TW.

The corresponding quality-of-life index is the one at the beginning of the\\nperiod. Dots represent 119 countries with populations larger than four million in\\nthe period 2005–2010. The line captures the global trend in the 30-year periodfrom 1980 to 2010.C. Pasten, J.C. Santamarina / Energy Policy 49 (2012) 468–476 4724.1. Scenario 1: status quo\\nThis scenario predicts the global energy consumption rate,\\nbased on historical increments of energy consumption rate per\\ncapita and the quality of life index. Since increments are very\\nsensitive to short-term transients, both the change in energy\\nconsumption rate DECR 5and the change in quality of life index\\nDQL5are considered as the average of the ﬁve-year increments\\nfrom 1980 to 2010. Extrapolation leads to unreasonable predic-\\ntions for a few countries. Although such anomalous predictions do\\nnot affect the global result, we impose two limits: the maximum\\nquality of life index is limited to QLr10 and the minimum energy\\nconsumption rate is restricted to ECR minZ0.1 kW/person.\\nFig. 6 shows the historical evolution and predictions of global\\nenergy consumption rate, quality of life index, and population for\\nthe status-quo scenario. Predictions by the International Energy\\nAgency ( IEA, 2009 ), the US Energy Information Administration\\n(EIA, 2010 ), the United Nations ( UN, 2011c ), and the US Census\\nBureau ( USCB, 2011 ) are superimposed on the ﬁgure and are in\\nclose agreement with the values predicted under the status-quo\\nscenario in this study. The global energy consumption rate\\nincreases to ECR global¼25.5 TW (50% increase), the associated\\nglobal quality of life index increases to QLglobal¼6.3 (26%\\nincrease), and the population rises to Pglobal¼8.9 billion (30%\\nincrease) in 30 years.\\n4.2. Scenario 2: limiting energy overspending\\nThis scenario limits the maximum energy consumption rate\\nper capita to ECR maxin high-consumption countries. As demon-\\nstrated in previous sections, the energy consumption rate can be\\nreduced to /C245 kW/person without affecting the quality of life\\nindex, and consequently the population growth rate. In this\\nscenario, all countries change their energy consumption andquality of life index according to the status-quo scenario, but\\nthey are not allowed to exceed the selected ECR\\nmaxvalue in the\\n30-year horizon. Fig. 7 shows that the predicted global energy\\nconsumption rate in 2040 decreases sharply as ECR maxis lowered,\\nand it could be similar to 2010 global consumption if ECR maxis\\nlimited to 3.7 kW/person in all countries. Given the assumptionsin this scenario, the global quality of life index and the world\\npopulation evolve as in the status-quo scenario.\\n4.3. Scenario 3: stimulating growth in the developing world\\nThis scenario considers that the minimum energy consump-\\ntion rate per capita in developing nations will increase to reach a\\ntarget value of ECR minin the 30-year horizon. If a country’s energy\\nconsumption rate is lower than ECR minby 2040, its consumption\\nis set to ECR min. In addition, its quality of life index is set to the\\nvalue given by the status quo mean plus one standard deviation\\ntrend in 2040 at ECR min. For all other countries, energy consump-\\ntion and quality of life index change according to the status-quo\\nscenario. Results in Fig. 7 show that raising the minimum energy\\nconsumption rate ECR min¼1 kW/person increases the global\\nenergy consumption rate by 7% and the global quality of life\\nindex by 11% above the status-quo scenario, whereas the world\\npopulation is the same as in the status quo prediction.\\n4.4. Scenario 4: improving energy-for-life efﬁciency\\nThis scenario imposes a minimum energy use efﬁciency from a\\nquality of life standpoint, i.e., ‘‘energy-for-life efﬁciency.’’ Coun-\\ntries develop as in the status-quo scenario only if their efﬁciency\\nangles are larger than amin[Eq. (4)]; otherwise, they are forced to\\nevolve with amin. The 5-year increment in energy consumption\\nrate per capita DECR 5is the same as in the status-quo scenario\\nwhereas the 5-year increment of the quality of life index DQL5is\\ngiven by the efﬁciency angle and the consumption increment,\\nDQL5¼DECR 5tana.Fig. 7 shows that the global energy consump-\\ntion rate decreases from the status quo value as the efﬁciency\\nangle increases. Eventually, efﬁciencies larger than a¼811lead to\\nenergy savings when compared to 2010 global consumption.\\nThe global quality of life index has a pronounced increase and\\nthe global population a drastic decrease with efﬁciency angles\\nlarger than a¼501. We note that 23 out of 110 countries\\nconsidered in Fig. 4 had efﬁciencies lower than a¼501in the\\n1980–2010 period.Table 1\\nAlgorithms for energy consumption scenarios.\\nVariable Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4\\nLimiting energyoverspendingStimulating growth in the\\ndeveloping worldImproving energy-for-life\\nefﬁciencyRestricting population growth\\naa curr(a)acurr(a)acurrifaminoacurro1801 acurr\\n(ECR 2010/C0ECR 1980)/6 aminifacurrramin\\nDECR 5 (ECR 2010/C0ECR 1980)/6 ( QL2010/C0QL1980)/6 ( ECR 2010/C0ECR 1980)/6 ( ECR 2010/C0ECR 1980)/6\\nDQL5 (QL2010/C0QL1980)/6 ECR jþDECR 5 DECR 5/C1tana (QL2010/C0QL1980)/6\\nECR jþ1(b)ECR jþDECR 5 EC2040ZECR min ECR jþDECR 5 ECR jþDECR 5\\nConstraint at year 2040 ECR 2040rECR max QL2040ZQL(ECR min)(c)Not applicable Not applicable\\nQLjþ1(d)QLjþDQL5 QLjþDQL5 QLjþDQL5 QLjþDQL5\\nPGjþ1 PGj/C0bPG(QLj/C0QLj/C01)(e)PGj/C0bPG(QLj/C0QLj/C01) PGj/C0bPG(QLj/C0QLj/C01) PGj/C0bPG(QLj/C0QLj/C01)rPGmax\\nPjþ1 Pj(1þPGjþ1) Pj(1þPGjþ1) Pj(1þPGjþ1) Pj(1þPGjþ1)\\nNotes:\\n(a)acurr¼tan/C01[(QL2010/C0QL1980)/(ECR 2010/C0ECR 1980)].\\n(b)ECR jþ1Z0.1 kW/person in scenarios 1 and 3.\\n(c)QL(ECR min)¼aECþbEClog(ECR min)þ2sbEC/(b2þ1)1/2.\\naECis the intercept, bECis the slope, and sis the standard deviation of the perpendicular distance to the mean log( ECR)/C0QLtrend in the status-quo scenario for 2040.\\n(d)QLmax¼10.\\n(e)bPG¼2.5 is the slope of the QL/C0PG5trend in Fig. 5 .\\n(f)jtojþ1 is a 5-year period.C.

Scenario 5: restricting population growth\\nThis scenario restricts the maximum population growth rate in\\nany 5-year period to a value PG5/C0max: if the status-quo scenario\\npredicts a population growth rate larger than PG5/C0maxin any\\n5-year interval between 2010 and 2040, the population growth\\nrate for the period is set to PG5/C0max. The energy consumption rate\\nper capita and the quality of life index evolve as in the status-quo\\nscenario, so only population growth affects the global energy\\nconsumption rate. This scenario predicts that the population in\\n2040 rises by 14% if the maximum population growth is set to\\nPG5/C0max¼4% for all countries (for comparison, the status-quo\\nscenario anticipates a 30% increase in population). The global\\nenergy consumption rate increases by 40%, and the global quality\\nof life index increases slightly above the status-quo value to\\nQLglobal¼6.5. Currently, 64% of the world’s population lives in\\ncountries with population growth rates larger than PG5¼4%\\n(79 out of 119 countries considered in Fig. 5 ).4.6. Scenario 6: combining energy and quality of life policies\\nMultiple actions can be combined to optimize worldwide\\nquality of life with minimal energy use. Consider the following\\nset of combined strategies: the maximum energy consumption\\nrate per capita is established at ECR max¼5 kW/person, the mini-\\nmum consumption is raised to reach ECR min¼1 kW/person, the\\nminimum efﬁciency is set to amin¼701, and the maximum 5-year\\npopulation growth rate is limited to PG5/C0max¼10%. Thus, the\\nglobal energy consumption rate in 2040 would increase by 14%\\nwith respect to 2010 consumption (status-quo: 50%), the global\\nquality of life index would reach QLglobal¼7.1 (status-quo:\\nQLglobal¼6.3), and the world population would be Pglobal¼8.1\\nbillion (status-quo: Pglobal¼8.9 billion).\\n4.7. Scenario 7: reducing social inequality\\nSocial inequality sustains internal tension, diminishes quality\\nof life, and hinders development ( Wilkinson, 2006 ). The Gini\\nindex is a measure of inequality: Gini ¼0 corresponds to perfect\\nequality whereas Gini ¼100 corresponds to perfect inequality.\\nFig. 8 shows a plot of the Gini index versus the quality of life\\nindex deﬁned in this study. Latin American countries exhibit\\nmarked inequality, i.e., a signiﬁcantly higher Gini index compared\\nto countries with a similar quality of life index. Disregarding Latin\\nAmerican countries, the general trend indicates that inequality\\ndecreases with an increase in quality of life.\\nIn the absence of disaggregated national data, the global\\nimpact of limiting inequality cannot be completed. Nevertheless,\\nthe nature of the non-linear relationship between energy con-\\nsumption rate per capita and quality of life index ( Fig. 2 ) suggests\\nthat improvements in impoverished societies lowers social\\ninequality, increases the overall quality of life, and has a minor\\neffect on a nation’s energy consumption. For example, combining\\ntrends in Figs. 2 and 4 allows us to predict that an increase in the\\naverage quality of life index DQL/QL0¼25% requires a energy\\nconsumption rate increase DECR/ECR 0¼18% at 0.1 kW/person,\\n29% at 1 kW/person, and 41% at 10 kW/person.\\n4.8. Comments\\nThe two variables in the proposed quality of life index, life\\nexpectancy and mean years of schooling, correlate with other\\nquality of life parameters. Therefore, improvements in the QL\\nindex will come together with improvements in all related\\nindicators in most cases, including enhanced access to clean\\nwater, electriﬁcation, and income.\\nScenarios analyzed in this study focus on quality of life and\\nassociated energy needs. They do not consider limitations in\\nenergy resources, the cost of energy and its implications, possible\\nrates of infrastructure deployment, and potential restrictions on\\ncarbon dioxide emissions ( H¨o¨ok et al., 2010 ).\\n5. Discussion and conclusions\\nGeneral observations : National averages of energy consumption\\nper capita range in three orders of magnitude. Approximately 6%\\nof the world population consumes less than 0.1 kW/person(i.e., the energy in a healthy diet), and 44% is below 1 kW/person\\n(i.e., the energy level required to attain an adequate quality of\\nlife given today’s technology). On the other hand, 15% of the\\nworld population consumes more than 5 kW/person (i.e., the\\nenergy required to attain the highest quality of life with today’s\\ntechnology).51525Historical\\nThis Study (Status Quo)\\nEIA (2010)\\nIEA (2009)\\n46810ECRglobal [TW]\\n02\\n46810\\n1980UN (2010)\\nU.S.C.B.

Santamarina / Energy Policy 49 (2012) 468–476 474Future energy demands will reﬂect the coupling between\\nenergy consumption, quality of life, population growth, social\\ninequality, and governments’ energy-for-life efﬁciency. Following\\ncurrent trends, the status-quo scenario anticipates a global power\\nconsumption of 25.5 TW by the year 2040, which is a 50% increase\\nfrom the 2010 level and an 8.5 TW increase in global demand in\\n30 years.\\nDeveloping countries —observations and policies :G r o w t hi n\\nthe developing world will cause a marked increase in globalenergy demand due to higher energy consumption rate per\\ncapita compounded with high va lues of current population\\ngrowth rates.\\nRestricted population growth limits global energy use. Never-\\ntheless, the impact of this single strategy on energy consumption\\nis not signiﬁcant unless the population growth rate in ﬁve year\\nintervals is limited to PG5/C0max¼5% worldwide, which is similar to\\nthe current population growth rate in the USA.\\nYet, signiﬁcant improvements in quality of life can be attained\\nwith a limited impact on energy demands in all nations, particu-\\nlarly in developing countries. In fact, several countries (including\\nMozambique and Cuba) have successfully increased their quality\\nof life with relatively low increases in energy consumption in the\\nlast decades. Furthermore, given the inverse correlation between\\nquality of life and population growth, improvements in quality of\\nlife may lead to decreased energy consumption.\\nStimulating growth in the developing world to attain a mini-\\nmum energy consumption rate per capita of ECR min¼1 kW/person\\nincreases the global energy consumption by only 7% above the\\nstatus-quo scenario and has a profound effect on global quality of\\nlife. To achieve this goal, emphasis should be placed on the\\nimplementation of available technology, the reduction in social\\ninequality, and renewed government policies to enhance energy-\\nfor-life efﬁciency. The widespread use of technology for efﬁcient\\nknowledge delivery and for optimal use of resources, low-cost\\nmedicines, and portable medical systems are examples of recent\\ndevelopments that can be made readily available worldwide to\\nimprove quality of life with a virtually null increase in energy\\ndemand.

Five hundred ethnically diverse undergraduates reported their\\nhappiness strategies – that is, activities undertaken to maintain or increase\\nhappiness. Factor analysis extracted eight general strategies: Aﬃliation, Par-\\ntying, Mental Control, Goal Pursuit, Passive Leisure, Active Leisure, Religion,\\nand Direct Attempts at happiness. According to multiple regression analyses,\\nthese strategies accounted for 52% of the variance in self-reported happiness\\nand 16% over and above the variance accounted for by the Big Five person-\\nality traits. The strongest unique predictors of current happiness were Mental\\nControl (inversely related), Direct Attempts, Aﬃliation, Religion, Partying,\\nand Active Leisure. Gender diﬀerences suggest that men prefer to engage in\\nActive Leisure and Mental Control, whereas women favor Aﬃliation, Goal\\nPursuit, Passive Leisure, and Religion. Relative to Asian and Chicano(a) stu-\\ndents, White students preferred using high arousal strategies. Finally, media-\\ntion analyses revealed that many associations between individuals’ personality\\nand happiness levels are to some extent mediated by the strategies they use to\\nincrease their happiness – particularly, by Aﬃliation, Mental Control, and\\nDirect Attempts.\\nKEY WORDS: aﬃliation, Big Five, factor analysis, goals, happiness, leisure,\\nmediation, mental control, personality, subjective well-being\\nThe inalienable right to the ‘‘pursuit of happiness’’ listed in the\\nU.S. Declaration of Independence illustrates the long-standing\\nAmerican preoccupation with well-being. Continuing to this\\nday, happiness is considered an integral part of a desirable life\\n(King and Napa, 1998) and the subject of most people’s daily\\nthoughts (Freedman, 1978). Perhaps as a result of this ﬁxation,\\nwThe authors would like to thank Sabine French for comments on earlier\\ndrafts and Andrew Comrey, Dan Ozer, and Chandra Reynolds for their\\nvaluable statistical advice.Journal of Happiness Studies (2006) 7:183–225 /C211Springer 2006\\nDOI 10.1007/s10902-005-4754-1self-help books about how to become happier have proliferated.\\nInterest in the sources of happiness inspires the age-old prob-\\nlem, ‘‘What can people do to become happier?’’ Embedded in\\nthis issue are two fundamental questions: ‘‘What speciﬁc strate-\\ngies do people use to try to make themselves happy?’’ and ‘‘Are\\nthese strategies eﬀective?’’ Surprisingly, to our knowledge, little\\nresearch has addressed these questions directly.\\nTo ﬁll the aforementioned gap in the well-being research lit-\\nerature, the present study aimed to identify the intentional\\nbehaviors that individuals engage in to pursue happiness. To that\\nend, the study had three general aims: First, we sought to derive\\nempirically the strategies that people report using to maintain or\\nincrease their happiness levels. Second, we aimed to evaluate the\\npredictive power of the individual strategies – that is, determine\\nwhich strategies are most strongly related to self-reported happi-\\nness. Third, we sought to test a process model of long-term happi-\\nness by examining the relations among personality traits,\\nhappiness strategies, and subjective happiness.\\nHappiness and Its Sources\\nHappiness is characterized by the experience of more frequent\\npositive affective states than negative ones (Bradburn, 1969), as\\nwell as by the perception that one is progressing toward impor-\\ntant life goals (Diener et al., 1999). Judgments of happiness\\ninvolve global aﬀective self-appraisals and aﬀect ratings, which\\nare inherently subjective (Myers and Diener, 1995). Chronic or\\nlong-term happiness, the focus of the present investigation, is\\nthe relatively stable level of positive well-being one experiences\\nover a speciﬁc time period, such as 3 or 6 months (Lyubomirsky,\\n2001; Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999).\\nResearch investigating the sources of happiness has focused\\non determining the strongest predictors of happiness and life\\nsatisfaction. Three general categories of happiness predictors\\nhave been identiﬁed: (1) life circumstances and demographics,\\n(2) traits and dispositions, and (3) intentional behaviors\\n(Lyubomirsky et al., 2005).CHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 184Circumstances and Demographics\\nAlthough circumstantial factors (e.g., income, place of residence,\\nemployment, injury) affect temporary mood, their effects tend to\\ndissipate over time and ultimately appear not to have a substantial\\neffect on enduring happiness (e.g., Brickman et al., 1978; Suh et\\nal., 1996). Similarly, demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, eth-\\nnicity) are weak predictors of happiness and account for a surpris-\\ningly small portion of happiness variance in most populations (see\\nDiener et al., 1999, for a review). Indeed, the meager predictive\\npower of life circumstances and demographic variables has led at\\nleast one researcher to conclude that these factors play a ‘‘negligi-\\nble role’’ in understanding happiness (Kammann, 1983).\\nPersonality Traits\\nIn contrast to demographic and circumstantial variables, per-\\nsonality traits account for a large portion of the variance in\\nindividual differences in happiness – as much as 40–50% (Di-\\nener et al., 1999) – and appear to be critical to well-being.\\nTraits are biologically-based, enduring dispositions (McCrae\\nand Costa, 1996) that include attitude and behavior com-\\nplexes, which are consistent across time and situations (All-\\nport, 1955). Research has repeatedly shown that certain\\npersonality traits are related to happiness, or subjective well-\\nbeing (see DeNeve and Cooper, 1998, for a review). For\\nexample, McCrae and Costa (1991) documented the relations\\nbetween the ﬁve-factor model of personality and the individual\\ncomponents of subjective well-being – that is, positive affect,\\nnegative affect, and life satisfaction.\\nResearchers have typically focused on the two most robust\\npredictors of happiness and well-being – extraversion and neu-\\nroticism. In general, extraverts report being happier than intro-\\nverts, and neurotic individuals report being less happy than\\nemotionally stable individuals (Costa and McCrae, 1980; Costa\\net al., 1987; Emmons and Diener, 1985; McCrae and Costa,\\n1991). Although relatively overlooked in comparison to the clo-\\nsely examined traits of extraversion and neuroticism, agreeable-\\nness and conscientiousness have also been found to be\\npositively related to happiness (McCrae and Costa, 1991).HOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 185McCrae and Costa (1991) proposed a number of ways that\\ntraits might inﬂuence happiness, two of which were the focus of\\nthe present investigation – namely, the temperamental and\\ninstrumental paths. To illustrate the temperamental causal path,\\nextraversion leads to positive aﬀect and neuroticism leads to\\nnegative aﬀect, and then, in turn, both traits andaﬀect inﬂuence\\nhappiness (Costa and McCrae, 1980; McCrae and Costa, 1991).\\nExperimental evidence supporting the temperamental causal\\nsequence for extraversion and neuroticism has been provided by\\nLarsen and Ketelaar (1989). Similarly, Rusting (1998) proposed\\nthat the linkage between traits and moods is such that traits pre-\\ndispose people to process mood-relevant information in a man-\\nner congruent with their dispositions. Thus, seeing the world\\nthrough rose-colored glasses may be considered equivalent to\\nseeing the world through the eyes of an extraverted optimist.\\nAlternatively, according to McCrae and Costa (1991), the\\ninstrumental causal sequence is illustrated by the notion of traits\\nestablishing conditions that are conducive to happiness or\\nunhappiness. For example, extraverts may frequently seek out\\nsocial activities and behaviors, which, in turn, inﬂuence positive\\nmoods, and, eventually, overall happiness. The instrumental\\nperspective can be applied to the study of the relations among\\nself-regulatory behaviors, transient mood, and chronic happi-\\nness. To illustrate, traits inﬂuence the conscious self-regulatory\\nactions that people take to manage their emotional lives – that\\nis, their happiness-enhancing ‘‘strategies.’’ Traits andstrategies\\nin turn, inﬂuence current mood, and, ultimately, overall happi-\\nness level.\\nEmmons et al. (1986) document just such a trait-behavior-\\naﬀect linkage. Speciﬁcally, they found that extraverts choose to\\nbe in social situations more so than did introverts, and that\\nwhile in their chosen social setting, extraverts are in a better\\nmood than when in an imposed non-social setting. More\\nrecently, Moskowitz and Cote ´(1995) found that it may not be\\nthe situation itself that leads to improved moods, but, rather,\\nthe behaviors that are elicited and then performed by the per-\\nson in the situation. In other words, extraverts are happier in\\nsocial settings because they are acting sociably.CHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 186These ﬁndings highlight how particular volitional behaviors,\\nsuch as happiness-increasing strategies, can mediate the relation\\nbetween dispositions and well-being. This process perspective\\nhas one fundamental advantage over the study of traits alone\\nwith regard to understanding how happiness can be elevated –\\nnamely, the fact that intentional behaviors are easier to modify\\nthan personality. Consequently, research ﬁndings in this area\\ncan be directly translated into prescriptive suggestions for\\nboosting well-being.\\nThe Self-Regulation of Moods\\nAlthough little research has been conducted on the activities\\nindividuals intentionally use to promote chronic, or long-term,\\nhappiness, much research has examined activities used to regu-\\nlate short-term moods – particularly, negative moods (see Morris\\nand Reilly, 1987, for a review). For example, Thayer et al. (1994)\\ncatalogued the activities that people use to get themselves out of a\\nbad mood, such as exercising, seeking out friends, and hobbies.\\nUnfortunately, this body of research suffers from two limita-\\ntions with regard to our present topic of intentional activities\\nused to promote happiness. First, with the exception of Thayer\\nand colleagues’ work (Thayer et al., 1994), much of this re-\\nsearch has focused on single behaviors, without attempting to\\nidentify the full range of intentional activities that people use to\\nalter their mood states. Second, and more important, the focus\\nof these studies has been the lifting of negative moods, not the\\npromotion of positive moods or well-being.\\nResearch on the self-regulation of mood does, however, offer\\none distinct advantage – in some cases, it provides experimental\\nevidence supporting the causal link between intentional behav-\\nior and mood change. For example, active distraction in the\\nform of exercise has been found to reduce negative mood\\n(Erber, 1996).\\nResearch has also shown that people often engage in activities\\nthat they believe will relieve negative mood, but, in the long\\nterm, these activities either have no beneﬁt or, worse yet, serve\\nto make people feel even worse. The most notable example of\\nthis maladaptive attempt at mood regulation is drinking alcohol.HOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 187Although drinking is a common mood regulatory activity (Hull\\nand Bond, 1986) and may relieve a negative mood in the short\\nterm, its continued use leads to depression and other negative\\nconsequences in the long term (Anshensel and Huba, 1983).\\nIt is also worth noting that men and women handle their\\nemotions in different ways. For example, women report using\\nsocial support more frequently than do men to combat negative\\nmoods (Thayer et al., 1994). However, the emotional beneﬁts\\nthat women gain through aﬃliation may be undercut by their\\ngreater tendency (relative to men) to ruminate about the causes\\nand consequences of their unhappiness (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991).\\nIn contrast, men tend to manage bad moods through pleasurable\\nand distracting activities, such as sports (Thayer et al.). Given\\nthese ﬁndings, it is likely that men and women also diﬀer in the\\nstrategies that they prefer to use to increase or maintain happiness.\\nFinally, ethnic differences have been reported in the corre-\\nlates of happiness and well-being (Adams, 1997; Diener, 1984),\\nand some predictors of well-being are stronger in particular cul-\\ntures than in others. For example, Diener and Diener (1995)\\nfound that self-esteem was a better predictor of subjective well-\\nbeing in nations with individualist cultures than in those with\\ncollectivist cultures. In light of these results, we tested whether\\nthe derived happiness strategies showed any diﬀerences for gen-\\nder or ethnicity.\\nSummary\\nThe happiness literature suggests that circumstantial factors\\nsuch as income and place of residence account for only a small\\nportion of the variance of happiness and are relatively unimpor-\\ntant (Kammann, 1983; Lyubomirsky, 2001). By contrast, dispo-\\nsitional traits account for a large portion of happiness variance\\n(Diener et al., 1999) and are clearly critical. However, up to\\n40% of the variance in individual diﬀerences in happiness is not\\naccounted for by circumstances and dispositions, and may be\\nlinked to intentional strategies and behaviors (Lyubomirsky\\net al., 2005). At the same time, the literature suggests that peo-\\nple use self-regulatory mechanisms to control their mood states\\n(Erber, 1996; Morris and Reilly, 1987). Finally, research revealsCHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 188gender and cultural diﬀerences in factors associated with happi-\\nness and satisfaction (Diener et al., 1999).\\nSeveral questions, however, remain unanswered. First, which\\nprecise strategies do people report using to maintain their own\\nhappiness? Second, are these happiness-increasing strategies\\neffective? And, ﬁnally, how do the happiness strategies relate to\\npersonality? The current study aimed to address these questions.\\nThe Present Study\\nThe ﬁrst aim of our exploratory study was to derive the happi-\\nness strategies that individuals use to maintain or increase their\\nhappiness levels and to explore individual differences in strategy\\nuse. We anticipated that the derived strategies would, in gen-\\neral, resemble self-regulatory behaviors used to control transient\\nmood (Erber, 1996; Morris and Reilly, 1987; Thayer et al.,\\n1994). Although gender and ethnic diﬀerences in frequency of\\nstrategy use were expected, speciﬁc hypotheses were not made\\nwith regard to these diﬀerences.\\nThe second aim was to evaluate the predictive power of the\\nderived strategies, and to identify those strategies with the stron-\\ngest associations to individuals’ current happiness. To this end,\\nthe relations between the strategies and happiness levels were as-\\nsessed. We expected the derived strategies to vary in the strength\\nand direction of their correlations with self-reported happiness.\\nThe third aim of the study was to assess the relations among\\npersonality traits, happiness-increasing strategies, and subjective\\nhappiness. Taking a process approach, the strategies, traits, and\\nreported happiness levels were subjected to a mediation analysis\\n(Baron and Kenny, 1986; Kenny et al., 1998). We predicted\\nthat strategies would partially mediate the relation between the\\n‘‘Big Five’’ personality traits and long-term happiness.\\nMETHOD\\nParticipants\\nFive hundred undergraduate students (341 females, 157 males, 2\\nunknown) participated by completing a questionnaire for courseHOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 189credit. The sample was ethnicall y diverse (8% African American,\\n38% Asian, 23% Caucasian, 19% Chicano/a, and 11% Other),\\nwith ages ranging from 17 to 35 years ( M=19.4, SD= 1.71).\\nProcedure\\nThe paper-and-pencil questionnaire was mass-distributed in a\\nlarge Introductory Psychology class at a state university. Stu-\\ndents ﬁlled out the questionnaire at home and returned it\\n1 week later. The questionnaire took less than 45 min to com-\\nplete.\\nMeasures\\nSubjective Happiness Scale (SHS; Lyubomirsky and Lepper,\\n1999)\\nThe SHS is a 4-item measure of subjective, chronic happiness.\\nThe ﬁrst item asks participants the extent to which they iden-\\ntify themselves as a happy person (1= not a very happy person ,\\n7=a very happy person ). The second item is a comparative\\nassessment that requires respondents to describe themselves\\ncompared to their peers (1= less happy ,7 = more happy ). The\\nthird item asks participants the extent to which a description\\nof a chronically happy person describes them: ‘‘Some people\\nare generally very happy. They enjoy life regardless of what is\\ngoing on, getting the most out of everything. To what extent\\ndoes this characterization describe you?’’ (1= not at all ,7 = a\\ngreat deal ). Lastly, the fourth item, which is reverse coded,\\ndescribes a chronically unhappy person: ‘‘Some people are\\ngenerally not very happy. Although they are not depressed,\\nthey never seem as happy as they might be.’’ Again, partici-\\npants are asked to judge the extent to which the characteriza-\\ntion is accurate in describing them (1= not at all ,7 = a great\\ndeal). This scale demonstrated very good reliability in this\\nstudy ( a=0.85).\\nHappiness-increasing Strategies\\nIn a pilot study, 70 students completed an open-ended survey in\\nwhich they were asked to ‘‘list things that [they] do to maintain\\nor increase [their] happiness level.’’ The students’ responses yieldedCHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 190a list of 66 happiness-enhancing strategies used in the present\\nstudy (see Table I) These were the 66 items that were most fre-\\nquently generated in the open-ended pilot survey. Examples in-\\ncluded ‘‘pursue life goals,’’ ‘‘study,’’ ‘‘spend time with friends,’’\\nand ‘‘watch TV.’’ In the present study, students were asked to rate\\neach of the 66 items on ‘‘how frequently [they] use this strategy to\\nincrease or maintain [their] happiness’’ (1= never,7 = all the time ).\\nBig Five Inventory (BFI; John et al., 1991)\\nThe BFI is a 44-item assessment of ﬁve primary personality\\ntraits – Openness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientious-\\nness, and Neuroticism. The scale asks respondents the extent to\\nwhich they agree that a particular characteristic applies to them\\n– that is, ‘‘I see myself as someone who is...‘‘ Examples include\\n‘‘Is curious about a number of things’’ (Openness), ‘‘Is outgo-\\ning, sociable’’ (Extraversion), ‘‘Likes to cooperate with others’’\\n(Agreeableness), ‘‘Does a thorough job’’ (Conscientiousness),\\nand ‘‘Worries a lot’’ (Neuroticism). The participants respond on\\na 5-point Likert-type scale (1= strongly disagree ,5 = strongly\\nagree ). (Approximately half the items were reverse coded.) Reli-\\nability for this study was good: a=0.74 (Openness), a=0.83\\n(Extraversion), a=0.77 (Agreeableness), a=0.77 (Conscientious-\\nness), and a=0.74 (Neuroticism).\\nRESULTS\\nOverview of Statistical Procedures\\nConsistent with the three aims of the study, three sets of statisti-\\ncal analyses were conducted. First, an exploratory factor analy-\\nsis was performed to derive happiness-increasing strategies from\\na larger set of behaviors used to ‘‘maintain or increase happi-\\nness.’’ Second, correlational analyses and multiple regression\\nanalyses were used to assess the relations between the derived\\nstrategies and happiness, and to evaluate the extent to which\\nhappiness strategies account for differences among individuals’\\nhappiness levels. Finally, mediation analyses were performed to deter-\\nmine how happiness strategies ﬁt into a process model of happiness.\\nThe last set of procedures modeled the paths among the Big Five\\ntraits, happiness-enhancing strategies, and long-term happiness.HOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 191TABLE I\\nFactors and loadings of happiness-increasing strategies\\nFactor Loading Factor Loading\\nStrategy I: Social Aﬃliation Strategy V: Passive Leisure\\nSupport and encourage friends 0.80 Watch TV/rent a video 0.56\\nHelp others 0.60 Surf the internet 0.52\\nSavor the moment 0.52 Go out to movies with friends 0.47\\nReceive support from friends 0.46 Stay home and enjoy quiet times 0.46\\nInteract/communicate with friends 0.44 Shop 0.42\\nFocus on maintaining relationships 0.43 Sleep 0.42\\nDraw 0.40 Read a book 0.38\\nClean 0.36 Sing 0.38\\nBecome absorbed in tasks 0.35 Spend quality time with self alone 0.35\\nCultivate a sense of humor 0.35 Strategy VI: Active Leisure\\nWork on social skills 0.32 Try to maintain health/ﬁtness 0.56\\nTry to become a better person 0.30 Work on my hobbies 0.52\\nStrategy II: Partying and Clubbing Exercise 0.43\\nParty 0.94 Seek work that uses my talents 0.39\\nGo out to clubs/bars with friends 0.88 Become absorbed in tasks 0.38\\nDrink alcohol 0.58 Lower stress level 0.35\\nGo out to meet people/be entertained 0.53 Go to the movies alone 0.32CHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 192Dance 0.48 Try to have self-control 0.31\\nTake illegal drugs 0.39 Strategy VII: Religion\\nStay home and enjoy quiet times )0.36 Seek support from faith 0.86\\nStrategy III: Mental Control Perform religious activities/pray, etc. 0.81\\nTry not to think about being unhappy 0.78 Drink alcohol )0.43\\nThink about what is wrong with life 0.72 Strategy VIII: Direct Attempts\\nTry to look at the positive but fail 0.66 Act happy/smile, etc 0.61\\nFocus out negative aspects of life 0.41 Get myself into happy mood 0.57\\nTake life as it is – be content )0.37 Decide to be happy 0.51\\nCultivate a bright outlook )0.34 Improve social skills 0.36\\nGo to the movies alone 0.33 Try to have self-control 0.36\\nTake illegal drugs 0.32 Write in journal )0.35\\nStrategy IV: Instrumental Goal Pursuit Draw )0.31\\nPursue career goals 0.75\\nAttempt to reach full potential 0.70\\nStudy 0.61\\nStrive to accomplish things 0.59\\nTry to do well academically/raise grades 0.58\\nOrganize life and goals 0.49HOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 193Factor Analysis: Deriving Happiness-Increasing Strategies\\nDescription of Analyses\\nA primary focus of this study was to derive empirically the\\nintentional behaviors that people use to make themselves happy\\n– that is, their happiness-increasing strategies. To that end, factor\\nanalytic procedures were used to extract 8 interpretable factors\\nfrom the original set of 66 items.\\nThe exploratory factor analytic procedures followed those\\noutlined by Comrey and Lee (1992). First, factors were extracted\\nusing the minimal residual method of extraction (Comrey, 1962).\\nThis technique minimizes the residual variance after each factor is\\nextracted. The advantage of this technique is that it does not im-\\npose communality estimates that can inﬂuence the results; rather,\\nthe minimum residual method operates on the oﬀ-diagonal ele-\\nments of the correlation matrix (Comrey and Lee, 1992). When\\ncommunalities are used, this technique is equivalent to a principal\\nfactor solution (Comrey and Lee, 1992).\\nNext, the results of minimum residual extraction are used in\\na two-stage tandem criteria orthogonal rotation procedure\\n(Comrey, 1967). In the present study, the factors were then ro-\\ntated using an oblique rotation procedure. An oblique rotation\\nwas chosen because it was expected that the factors would re-\\nlate to one another; forcing an orthogonal structure thus did\\nnot seem appropriate.\\nHappiness-increasing Strategies\\nThe eight derived factors (happiness strategies), their loadings,\\nand the original items are shown in Table I. These factors were\\nSocial Aﬃliation (or ‘‘Aﬃliation’’), Partying and Clubbing\\n(‘‘Partying’’), Mental Control, Instrumental Goal Pursuit (‘‘Goal\\nPursuit’’), Passive Leisure and Active Leisure (cf. Csikszentmihal-\\nyi and Hunter, 2003), Religion, and Direct Attempts. The factor\\nscores were generated by summing th e variables from each factor with\\na coeﬃcient of 0.4 or greater and then averaging for a single unit-\\nweighted score.1A standardized factor score was also tried – that is,\\nthe items were standardized before the average was taken. Because the\\nresults from the raw and the standardized scores were virtually identi-\\ncal, only the results for the raw scores are presented.CHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 194The descriptive statistics for the happiness strategies are pre-\\nsented in Table II. Overall, Social Aﬃliation and Instrumental\\nGoal Pursuit were the most frequently used strategies\\n(M’s=5.38 and 5.18, respectively), whereas Partying and Men-\\ntal Control were the least frequently used strategies ( M’s=3.56\\nand 3.47, respectively). It is also noteworthy that, for many of\\nthe strategies, the reported usage spanned the full range from 1\\n(never )t o7( all the time ).\\nTable II also highlights gender diﬀerences.

In sum, women reported using Aﬃliation, Goal Pursuit,\\nPassive Leisure, and Religion signiﬁcantly more frequently than did\\nmen, whereas men used Mental Control and Active Leisure signiﬁ-\\ncantly more than did women.\\nTable III indicates the ethnic diﬀerences found in the fre-\\nquency of strategy use. Overall, Religious Activities showed the\\ngreatest variability with regard to ethnicity.

Ethnic diﬀerences were also found for Mental Con-\\ntrol and Active Leisure. Asian students attempted to control\\ntheir thoughts the most ( M=3.71), compared to Chicano/a\\n(M=3.35) and Caucasian ( M=3.09) students. With regard to\\nActive Leisure, both Caucasian ( M=4.69) and Asian students\\n(M=4.56) used this strategy more often than did Chicano/a\\nstudents ( M=4.18).\\nIntercorrelations of the Happiness-increasing Strategies\\nThe internal consistencies and intercorrelations of the happi-\\nness strategies are presented in Table IV. Overall, the strategies\\nshowed good reliabilities in most cases, with Cronbach’s alphas\\nranging from 0.86 (Goal Pursuit) to 0.66 (Passive Leisure). With\\nonly a few exceptions, all the strategies signiﬁcantly correlated\\nwith one another. Notably, the four strategies of Goal Pursuit,\\nAﬃliation, Direct Attempts, and Active Leisure were moderately\\nassociated with one another (average r=0.36). That is, individu-\\nals who report actively pursuing goals also tend to socialize,\\nexercise, and use direct attempts at maintaining or increasing\\nhappiness. Passive Leisure and Religion were also signiﬁcantly re-\\nlated to this group of happiness strategies, albeit, to a lesser de-\\ngree. Finally, Mental Control was inversely related to all the\\nstrategies except for Passive Leisure.\\nCorrelational and Regression Analyses: Evaluating\\nthe Happiness-Increasing Strategies\\nTo evaluate the predictive power of the derived strategies, the\\nsecond aim of the study, we assessed the relations between\\nparticipants’ reported frequency of strategy use and their happi-\\nness levels.\\nCorrelational Analyses\\nThe zero-order correlations between the frequency ratings of the\\nstrategies and self-rated happiness are found in Table V.

The strongest positive rela-\\ntions were found for Social Aﬃliation ( r=0.45) and Direct At-\\ntempts ( r=0.40). Passive Leisure was not signiﬁcantly related to\\nhappiness ( r=.07) and Mental Control was inversely related to\\nhappiness ( r=)0.56).2\\nFinally, we tested whether the link between happiness and\\nstrategy use varied by gender. The only signiﬁcant gender differ-\\nence in the relations between strategy use and happiness was\\nfound for the strategy of Direct Attempts ( r=0.47 for males vs.\\nr=0.36 for females).\\nRegression Analyses\\nSimultaneous regression was used to assess the predictive power\\nof the set of happiness-increasing strategies (i.e., R2), as well as\\nthe unique predictive power of each strategy (i.e., b). Table V\\ndisplays the results of the regression analyses, which are divided\\ninto two parts: The top part reports the results when happiness\\nwas predicted by happiness-enhancing strategies only, and the\\nbottom part reports the results when happiness was predicted\\nby strategies andtraits.\\nAs Table V shows, intentional happiness strategies are\\nimportant predictors of happiness levels; thus, researchers can\\nreliably predict how happy a person is by knowing how fre-\\nquently he or she uses these eight types of happiness strategies.\\nWhen happiness was predicted by happiness strategies alone,\\nstrategies accounted for a substantial proportion of variance for\\nhappiness ( R2=0.52, p<0.0001). Mental Control (inversely re-\\nlated) was by far the most robust single predictor of happiness,\\nfollowed by Direct Attempts, Social Aﬃliation, Religion, Party-\\ning and Clubbing, and Active Leisure. Both Passive Leisure\\nand, surprisingly, Instrumental Goal Pursuit failed to uniquely\\npredict happiness in the regression model.\\nTable V also displays the semi-partial correlations.

To that end, we examined the relations among per-\\nsonality traits, happiness-increasing strategies, and happiness\\nlevels. First, we assessed the correlations between traits and\\nhappiness strategies (see Table VI). Next, we used structural\\nequation modeling (SEM) to test the hypothesis that happiness-\\nincreasing strategies would partially mediate the relation be-\\ntween personality traits and happiness. One advantage of SEM\\nis that it corrects for measurement error in the constructs of\\ninterest – an issue relevant to the present study. Although the\\nreliabilities of the derived factors were good in most cases, there\\nwas quite a bit of variability (i.e., a‘s ranged from 0.86 to 0.66).\\nOur approach was to test whether the relation between each\\nof the ﬁve personality traits and happiness was mediated by\\neach happiness strategy (see Figure 1). The path crepresents the\\ndirect relation between the trait and level of happiness when the\\nmediator is not included in the model (the unmediated direct\\npath).

Therefore, we chose to\\nfocus on the two other ﬁt indices – the GFI and the RMSEA.\\nFor the GFI, a reasonable ﬁt is indicated by values greater than\\n0.90 (Brown and Cudeck, 1992). For the RMSEA, values be-\\ntween 0.05 and 0.10 indicate a good ﬁt (Bentler and Bonett,\\n1980; Loehlin, 1998). According to these indices, all models\\ndemonstrated a reasonable, or close-to-reasonable, ﬁt.\\nAlso found in the Mediated column are (1) the change in\\nk2when path ais included vs. when ais not included ( Dk2\\n[1]); (2) the standardized path coeﬃcients ( a,b,c¢); (3) the\\npercentage of change in the direct path due to the mediator\\n(%Dc); (4) a test of signiﬁcance of the indirect paths ( Z),3\\nand (5) the amount of variance in happiness accounted for\\nby the model (R2).4\\nTable VII shows that only one model met the criteria for\\ncomplete mediation – that is, Openness was completely medi-\\nated by Social Afﬁliation. However, many models demon-\\nstrated partial mediation as evidenced by the following\\ncriteria: (1) the ﬁt indices – particularly the Dk2(aDk2[1] of\\ngreater than 3.84 [ p<0.05] suggests that the mediated model\\nis a better ﬁt to the observed data than the unmediated mod-\\nel); (2) the percent change in the direct relation between the\\ntrait and happiness level; and (3) the signiﬁcant indirect path\\nfrom the initial variable (trait) through the mediator (strat-\\negy) and to the outcome (happiness).\\nTo illustrate, the strategy of Social Afﬁliation partially\\nmediated the relation between Extraversion and happiness.\\nSpeciﬁcally, Extraversion predicted Afﬁliation (0.49), which, in\\nturn, predicted happiness (0.34). Overall, the mediated model\\nﬁt the data reasonably well (GFI=0.88, RMSEA=0.08); the\\naddition of path asigniﬁcantly decreased k2(Dk2[1]=84.61,\\np<0.001); and the combined indirect paths ( ab) were signiﬁ-\\ncant ( Z=4.85, p<0.001). Moreover, the inclusion of Aﬃlia-\\ntion accounted for 30% of the initial relation between\\nExtraversion and happiness (% Dc=0.30). Finally, the combi-\\nnation of Extraversion and Social Aﬃliation accounted for a\\nsizeable proportion of the variance of happiness ( R2=0.39).HOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 207Similar results with regard to Extraversion are shown for\\nMental Control ( Dk2[1]=45.51, p<0.001; Z=5.45, p<0.001;\\n%Dc=0.35) and Direct Attempts ( Dk2[1]=37.11, p<0.001;\\nZ=4.16, p<0.001; % Dc=0.18). In sum, the relation between\\nExtraversion and happiness is partially mediated through\\nhappiness-enhancing strategies – namely, Social Afﬁliation,\\nMental Control, Direct Attempts, and Active Leisure (albeit\\nto a lesser extent).\\nIn general, the majority of mediation models showed a signif-\\nicant improvement in ﬁt based on the single degree of freedom\\nDk2. Additionally, nearly all of the indirect paths were found to\\nbe statistically signiﬁcant (with the exception of the two indirect\\npaths for Partying and Clubbing marked with an asterisk).\\nThese ﬁndings indicate that these paths are important and, con-\\nsequently, should be included in the model. Taken together, the\\nmediated models tended to provide a better explanatory\\nrepresentation of the relations between the constructs than the\\nunmediated models.\\nMost noteworthy were the observed percentage drops in the\\nrelation between traits and happiness after the mediator was\\nincluded in the model. The largest proportion of change was for\\nOpenness and Social Afﬁliation (78%) and the least was for\\nExtraversion and Partying/Clubbing ( )0.04). For the latter, it\\nappears that the relation between Extraversion and happiness\\nmay actually be undercut by Partying.\\nNotably, Neuroticism showed the most direct predictive power\\n– that is, it was the trait least mediated by strategies. The only\\nstrategy that accounted for a sizeable proportion of the relation\\nbetween Neuroticism and happiness was Mental Control (45%).\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe present study sought to identify the strategies that people\\nemploy to maintain or increase their chronic happiness. To that\\nend, we empirically derived eight reported happiness-enhancing\\nstrategies – namely, Social Afﬁliation, Partying and Clubbing,\\nMental Control, Instrumental Goal Pursuit, Passive Leisure,\\nActive Leisure, Religion, and Direct Attempts at happiness. OurCHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 208ﬁndings suggest that these self-regulatory happiness-boosting\\nstrategies are inter-related with personality traits, such that\\ntraits predict the use of certain happiness-increasing strategies,\\nand both traits and happiness strategies jointly predict happi-\\nness levels.\\nThe Derivation and Evaluation of Happiness-Increasing Strategies\\nFactor-analytic techniques were used to detect underlying simi-\\nlarities among the responses generated from a pilot open-ended\\nsurvey of what people do to enhance happiness. In this manner,\\nspeciﬁc self-reported happiness-enhancing behaviors were inte-\\ngrated into more general happiness strategies. Interestingly,\\nmany of the strategies resembled mood regulatory behaviors\\n(Thayer et al., 1994; see Morris and Reilly, 1987 for a review),\\nsuggesting that a large component of happiness maintenance\\ninvolves mood regulation.\\nThe second aim of the study was to determine which strate-\\ngies are most closely linked to happiness. As anticipated, the\\nstrategies’ relations to happiness varied greatly. Thus, our ﬁnd-\\nings, combined with past research evidence, suggest that the\\neffectiveness of the strategies is also likely to vary. Although no\\ndeﬁnitive conclusions can be made based on the present correla-\\ntional data, we would be remiss for not discussing the strate-\\ngies’ potential effectiveness.\\nWhat do People do to Make Themselves Happy?\\nSocial Afﬁliation\\nCharacterized by such items as ‘‘helping others’’ and ‘‘commu-\\nnicating with friends,’’ the ﬁrst factor and the most frequently\\nused strategy that emerged was Social Afﬁliation. Importantly,\\nAfﬁliation showed a strong positive relation to happiness, even\\nafter controlling for the other strategies. This ﬁnding is sup-\\nported by studies showing a link between social activities and\\nhappiness. For example, research shows that people are happier\\nwhile in the presence of others (Csikszentmihalyi and Hunter,\\n2003; Pavot et al., 1990), and social aﬃliation is rated as an\\neﬀective strategy in combating dysphoria (Thayer et al., 1994)\\nand stress (Cohen and Wills, 1985). Furthermore, experimentsHOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 209that have manipulated social activity have produced increases in\\nhappiness (Fordyce, 1977, 1983; Lyubomirsky et al., 2005). It is\\nalso noteworthy that aﬃliation was related to other strategies –\\nnamely, Instrumental Goal Pursuit, Direct Attempts, Active\\nLeisure, and Religion, as well as to Partying and Clubbing.\\nPartying and Clubbing\\nThe second strategy to appear, and the second least used one,\\nwas Partying and Clubbing. On the surface, this strategy\\nappears to involve the maintenance of present good moods. In-\\ndeed, the behaviors that make up this strategy suggest a cele-\\nbratory aspect (e.g., party, dance, go out to clubs). However,\\nthe frequency of Partying was only moderately correlated with\\nhappiness levels. Furthermore, when Partying was included in\\nthe mediation analysis with Extraversion, its predictive power\\ndropped to non-signiﬁcance. However, Partying was closely\\nrelated to Extraversion in the same analysis. Together, these\\nﬁndings suggest that Partying is more closely akin to Extraver-\\nsion than to happiness directly.\\nMental Control\\nIn contrast to the other strategies that emerged, Mental Control\\nappears to be associated with unhappiness – particularly, with\\nunhappy moods, thoughts, or unpleasant matters. To illustrate,\\nitems that reﬂected this strategy included ‘‘Try not to think\\nabout unhappy thoughts’’ and ‘‘Think about what is wrong with\\nlife.’’ Notably, a certain ambiguity characterizes this factor. Spe-\\nciﬁcally, some items demonstrate an attempt to eschew negative\\nthoughts, whereas other items reﬂect an attempt to contemplate\\nnegative themes. However, it is clear that this strategy is charac-\\nterized by the experience of negative thoughts or feelings and the\\nperson’s focus of attention on those negative experiences.\\nThe strategy of Mental Control was inversely related to hap-\\npiness even after controlling for the other strategies. The inverse\\nrelation between the reported frequency of this strategy and hap-\\npiness levels suggests that the use of this strategy to promote\\nhappiness is less than optimal. Research supports the futility of\\ncontrolling or suppressing feelings and thoughts. For example,\\nthe suppression of emotional expression appears to be an inef-CHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 210fective way of controlling emotions and is negatively related to\\nwell-being (Gross and John, 2003). Indeed, research suggests\\nthat thought suppression may intensify and prolong unhappiness.\\nFor example, when individuals attempt to inhibit unwanted\\nthoughts directly, the unwanted thoughts may actually be main-\\ntained (Wegner, 1994; Wenzlaﬀ et al., 1991). Additionally,\\nresearch shows that focusing on the causes and consequences of\\na negative mood is maladaptive, because it serves to maintain\\nand exacerbate negative aﬀect (see Lyubomirsky and Tkach,\\n2004, for a review).\\nInstrumental Goal Pursuit\\nThe next strategy that emerged was labeled Instrumental Goal\\nPursuit because the individual items suggest that the person\\nusing this strategy is acting as an agent attempting to change\\nher situation (e.g., ‘‘Strive to accomplish things’’) or herself\\n(e.g., ‘‘Attempt to reach full potential’’). Notably, the nature of\\nthe individual items comprising this factor varied in a distinc-\\ntively hierarchical manner. For example, the items ranged from\\nabstract, meta-goals (e.g., ‘‘Organize life and goals’’) to speciﬁc\\ndaily tasks (e.g., ‘‘Study’’). Given that the sample was com-\\nprised of college students, it is not surprising that using Goal\\nPursuit was one of the most frequently used strategies. It also\\nappears to be one of the most effective strategies. The commit-\\nment to and attainment of personal goals has been linked in\\nmany studies to positive moods and well-being (e.g., Carver and\\nScheier, 1981; Emmons, 1986; Emmons and Diener, 1986;\\nSheldon and Elliot, 1999).\\nPassive Leisure\\nIn contrast to the high-motivation nature of Goal Pursuit, the\\nstrategy of Passive Leisure is characterized by idleness. Items\\nthat loaded on this factor included ‘‘Watching TV,’’ ‘‘Playing\\nvideo games,’’ and ‘‘Sleep.’’ Although these activities seem to be\\nrelaxing and pleasurable, frequent use of the strategy of Passive\\nLeisure was not related to happiness. This ﬁnding was not sur-\\nprising. Past experimental studies show that, although perform-\\ning vigorous activities (e.g., exercise) lifts negative moods,HOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 211passive activities (e.g., watching a video of someone else\\nexercise) have no effect on moods (Erber, 1996).\\nActive Leisure\\nUnlike Passive Leisure, the strategy of Active Leisure was a\\nstrong predictor of happiness, even after controlling for the\\nother strategies. The three items that loaded most strongly on\\nthis factor were ‘‘Try to maintain health and ﬁtness,’’ ‘‘Work\\non hobbies,’’ and ‘‘Exercise.’’\\nA number of studies support the link between exercise and\\nwell-being (see Dubbert, 2002, for a review). In contrast to the\\nmaladaptive control of unwanted thoughts, distraction – or the\\nfocus of attention away from the self-appears to be a very\\nadaptive self-regulatory behavior (Erber, 1996; Nolen-Hoek-\\nsema, 1991; Thayer et al., 1994). Corroborating this conclusion\\nis research documenting that exercise is related to lower levels\\nof stress, anxiety, and depression (Salmon, 2000), improved\\nmood (Rejeski et al., 1995), and greater likelihood of ﬂow\\n(Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Furthermore, people self-report exer-\\ncise as an eﬀective strategy to ﬁght negative moods (Thayer\\net al., 1994). Even more convincing is experimental evidence\\nshowing that exercise serves to reduce negative aﬀect (Erber,\\n1996). Thus, not surprisingly, the present ﬁndings show a strong\\nrelation between distracting behaviors, such as Active Leisure,\\nand self-reported happiness.\\nReligion\\nThe strategy of Religion (e.g., ‘‘Praying’’ and ‘‘Performing reli-\\ngious ceremonies’’) was one of the least frequently used\\nmethods to boost happiness. Although it was not a popular\\nstrategy, it may have been an effective one – that is, a strong\\npredictor of happiness. Moreover, a sizeable body of research\\nsupports the link between faith and well-being (see Gartner et\\nal., 1991; Myers, 2000, for a reviews), likely because religious\\nactivity provides increased social connectedness, as well as a\\nsense of life purpose. The strong negative loading of ‘‘drinking\\nalcohol’’ on this factor also highlights how this strategy could\\nhave an indirect inﬂuence on long-term happiness. Speciﬁcally,\\nresearch shows that those individuals who routinely performCHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 212religious behaviors abstain from partaking in maladaptive\\nbehaviors such as drug and alcohol abuse (Batson et al., 1993).\\nDirect Attempts\\nIn contrast to the relatively inactive strategy of Passive Leisure,\\nthe strategy of Direct Attempts is proactive and direct in nature\\n(e.g., ‘‘Smile,’’ ‘‘Act happy’’). This moderately common strategy\\nwas found to be an excellent predictor of happiness, supporting\\nMorris and Reilly’s (1987) argument that expressive behavior\\ncan lift negative moods. Of course, the causal direction of these\\nbehaviors is unknown in the present study. That is, expressive\\nbehaviors could be the outward manifestation of already experi-\\nenced happiness, rather than a consequence of a conscious hap-\\npiness-increasing strategy; consequently, the discussion of this\\nfactor as a ‘‘happiness-enhancing strategy’’ may be premature at\\nthis time.\\nNevertheless, the participants reported these expressive\\nbehaviors as intentional happiness-increasing strategies, and the\\nﬁndings suggest that Direct Attempts at happiness are strongly\\nrelated to experienced happiness. Moreover, since the time of\\nDarwin (1965/1872) and James (1950/1890), the expression of\\nemotion has been thought to heighten the intensity of emotional\\nexperience. More recently, experiments in which participants\\nhave been assigned to physically express happiness, anger, fear,\\nor sadness show that simply acting out the behaviors associated\\nwith particular emotions serves to intensify or even trigger that\\nemotion (e.g., Duclos et al., 1989; Strack et al., 1988). So, by\\nacting happy, it may be possible to make oneself happy.\\nGender Differences\\nAlthough the men and women in our sample reported being\\nequally happy, gender differences did emerge in the frequency\\nof using particular happiness-enhancing strategies. Men re-\\nported attempting to boost happiness with Active Leisure (e.g.,\\nexercise) and Mental Control (e.g., try not to think about un-\\nwanted thoughts) more frequently than did women. Except for\\nexercise, which could involve social interaction, these activities\\nare relatively solitary in nature. Women, in contrast to men,\\ntended to use Social Afﬁliation (e.g., focus on maintainingHOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 213relationships), Instrumental Goal Pursuit (e.g., study and pur-\\nsue career goals), Passive Leisure (e.g., watch TV, rent video,\\nshopping), and Religion (e.g., perform religious activities).\\nThese differences are not surprising given the long-standing\\nevidence that women prefer social afﬁliation more than do\\nmen (Chodorow, 1978). Overall, the gender diﬀerences found\\nin the present study are consistent with the gender diﬀerences\\nreported for behaviors used to combat bad moods (Thayer\\net al., 1994).\\nEthnic Differences\\nOverall, few ethnic differences were observed in the use of hap-\\npiness-enhancing strategies. However, the ethnic differences that\\ndid emerge highlight the theoretically important features of hap-\\npiness-boosting strategies and of happiness, in general. For\\nexample, in contrast to their Asian and Chicano(a) peers, White\\nstudents reported Partying and participating in Active Leisure\\nmost frequently, and used Passive Leisure and Mental Control\\nleast frequently. These ﬁndings are consistent with research doc-\\numenting that members of individualist cultures prefer high-\\narousal positive emotions (e.g., excitement and enthusiasm),\\nwhereas members of collectivist cultures prefer low-arousal\\nemotions (e.g., tranquility and calm) (Tsai et al., in press). In\\nsum, these ethnic differences suggest that an individual’s choice\\nof happiness-enhancing strategies may depend on what aspects\\nof happiness he or she values most. That is, how one pursues\\nhappiness depends on one’s ‘‘ideal’’ beliefs regarding the experi-\\nence of happiness.\\nEvaluating the Full Set of Happiness-Increasing Strategies\\nWe also evaluated the happiness strategies as a set of\\npredictors. As expected, regression analyses showed that happi-\\nness-increasing strategies accounted for a sizeable portion of the\\nvariance in individual differences in happiness levels. Indeed,\\nhappiness strategies accounted for more variance (52%) than\\ndid the Big Five personality traits (46%). Moreover, happiness\\nstrategies continued to account for a substantial portion of the\\nvariance of happiness (16%) even after controlling for theCHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 214contribution of personality. Such empirical evidence supports\\nthe usefulness of studying intentional behaviors as important\\ndeterminants of happiness.\\nThe best predictors of happiness, after controlling for the\\neffect of the other strategies, were Mental Control (inversely\\nrelated), Direct Attempts, Social Afﬁliation, Religion, Partying,\\nand Active Leisure (in that order). When placed in the multiple\\nregression model, Passive Leisure and Instrumental Goal Pur-\\nsuit failed to predict happiness.\\nAlthough the ﬁndings for Passive Leisure were not surprising\\ngiven past research (e.g., Erber, 1996), the lack of predictive\\npower for Instrumental Goal Pursuit was unexpected and some-\\nwhat equivocal. Whereas the bivariate correlations showed a\\nstrong relation between Goal Pursuit and happiness, the multi-\\nple regression did not. One possible reason for this discrepancy\\nis the strong association between Social Aﬃliation (a strong\\npredictor of happiness) and Goal Pursuit. The high correlation\\nbetween these two strategies and a perusal of their items sug-\\ngests some construct overlap. For example, Aﬃliation items\\nsuch as ‘‘maintaining relationships’’ and ‘‘helping others’’ can\\nalso be considered social goals. This construct overlap may thus\\nbe driving down the unique relation between Goal Pursuit and\\nhappiness. Alternatively, the six items that were used to repre-\\nsent goals may not adequately represent this construct, and dif-\\nferent facets of goal pursuit not captured by our instrument\\nmay strongly predict happiness even within the context of other\\nstrategies. Finally, it may be that the pursuit and attainment of\\ngoals promotes aspects of well-being not captured by our sub-\\njective happiness scale.\\nTraits and Happiness-Increasing Strategies: Towards a Process\\nModel of Chronic Happiness\\nThe ﬁnal aim of this study was to assess the relations among\\nhappiness-increasing strategies, personality traits, and chronic\\nhappiness. Overall, our ﬁndings reveal a number of complex\\nrelationships.\\nFirst, not surprisingly, we found that people use different\\nhappiness-enhancing strategies depending on their personality.HOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 215For example, extraverts are more likely to use the strategy of\\nSocial Afﬁliation (support and encourage friends) than are\\nintroverts. Similarly, highly conscientious people tend to use\\nInstrumental Goal Pursuit (e.g., study and pursue career goals);\\nagreeable people are inclined to use Social Afﬁliation, presum-\\nably to go along with the crowd (e.g., interact/communicate\\nwith friends); and neurotics tend to use maladaptive Mental\\nControl (e.g., try not to think about unhappy thoughts).\\nNext, we found that intentional happiness-increasing strate-\\ngies partially mediated the relation between personality traits\\nand happiness levels. This ﬁnding supported our prediction that\\nat least part of the relation between traits and happiness is not\\ndirect, but passes through behaviors that aim to elevate happi-\\nness. For example, extraverts are happier than introverts. How-\\never, the relation between extraversion and happiness is not an\\nentirely direct one. Rather, a more complex process seems to be\\nat work, such that extraversion is related to the use of the Social\\nAfﬁliation strategy, which, in turn, is related to happiness.\\nAlthough, no causal conclusions can be drawn based on this\\nobservational study, other investigations corroborate our ﬁnd-\\nings. For example, in a daily experience sampling study, extra-\\nverts chose to be in social situations more than did introverts,\\nand reported being in better moods in those chosen social situa-\\ntions than while in imposed solitary situations (Emmons et al.,\\n1986).\\nOur ﬁnding regarding Extraversion and Social Afﬁliation is\\nnot surprising, given that Extraversion is, by deﬁnition, linked\\nto social interactions. However, Extraversion was also partially\\nmediated, albeit to a lesser degree, by Mental Control, Direct\\nAttempts, and Active Leisure. Together, these ﬁndings suggest\\nthat the strong relation between Extraversion and happiness is a\\nfunction of a number of happiness-enhancing behaviors.\\nNotably, a similar pattern emerged across the traits – indeed,\\nall the personality traits were to some extent mediated by happi-\\nness-enhancing acts. Together, these ﬁndings support McCrae\\nand Costa’s (1991) contention that traits have an instrumental\\ninﬂuence on happiness. Speciﬁcally, particular traits appear to\\npredispose people to choose certain situations and self-regulatoryCHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 216behaviors, and these behaviors, in turn, inﬂuence their happiness\\nlevels. The best mediators were Social Aﬃliation, Mental Con-\\ntrol, Direct Attempts, and, to a lesser degree, Active Leisure.\\nAlso noteworthy is that not all traits were completely medi-\\nated by happiness-enhancing behaviors – speciﬁcally, Neuroti-\\ncism was the least mediated of the personality traits. This\\nﬁnding supports McCrae and Costa’s (1991) argument – at least\\nwith regard to the trait of Neuroticism – for a temperamental\\ninﬂuence of traits on happiness. Past experimental evidence sup-\\nports the notion that traits may predispose individuals to pay\\nattention to, interpret, and biologically react to the environment\\nin a prescribed manner. For example, dispositionally pessimistic\\nindividuals tend to have an unconscious attention bias for nega-\\ntive stimuli, whereas optimists show the reverse bias\\n(Segerstrom, 2001). Moreover, while viewing negative stimuli,\\npessimists have faster skin conductance rates than optimists\\n(Segerstrom, 2001). Similar results have been reported for Neu-\\nroticism – individuals high in Neuroticism tend to react more\\nintensely to negative events than those low in Neuroticism\\n(Larson and Ketelaar, 1989).\\nConclusion\\nAlthough no causal conclusions can be reached concerning the\\npresent study’s ﬁndings, they are consistent with McCrae and\\nCosta’s (1991) arguments for both an instrumental and temper-\\namental inﬂuence of traits on well-being. Our ﬁndings highlight\\nthe interaction between traits and behaviors as central to happi-\\nness maintenance and well-being.\\nLIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTED AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH\\nCausal Direction\\nInherent to a correlational design is the failure to know for\\ncertain the direction of causality of the variables under\\ninvestigation. Indeed, the direction of causality between happi-\\nness-increasing strategies and happiness levels is open to\\nquestion. An argument can be made that causality runs in the\\nreverse direction, such that an individual’s happiness may be theHOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 217global disposition that inﬂuences both his personality and the\\nstrategies he chooses to undertake. However, our lack of certainty\\nregarding the causal direction of these ﬁndings is offset by numer-\\nous past supportive studies that have used experimental designs.\\nUltimately, to reach causal conclusions, experimental designs in\\nwhich participants are encouraged to implement particular happi-\\nness strategies should be used in future investigations.\\nInterpretation of Factors\\nCentral to all exploratory factor analytic endeavors are issues of\\nfactor purity and interpretation. In the present study, the most\\nnotable concerns pertain to the strategies of Mental Control\\nand Direct Attempts. Both contain ambiguities, leading to only\\ntentative interpretation at this stage. Future research efforts are\\nneeded to validate the strategies and render them more unequiv-\\nocal. Overall, however, we are encouraged by the similarity of\\nour ﬁndings to past research, and the fact that the emerged fac-\\ntors related to the other constructs in the study in a theoreti-\\ncally meaningful way.\\nSuperﬁcial Coverage\\nAnother limitation concerns our wide, yet superﬁcial,\\ninvestigation of the complex processes involved. This mile-wide-\\ninch-deep study undoubtedly missed factors that might serve to\\nmoderate the proposed relations. For example, the pursuit and\\nattainment of goals is related to well-being (Emmons, 1986;\\nEmmons and Diener, 1986), but only when the person is intrin-\\nsically motivated to pursue the goal (Kasser and Ryan, 1996)\\nand when the goal is concordant with her interests and values\\n(Sheldon and Elliot, 1999). Future studies may need to assess\\nsuch factors. However, we felt that this broad investigation was\\nnecessary in the initial research stages, and is oﬀset by several\\nadvantages. First, the value of this study lies in its exploratory\\nnature, as its ﬁndings are expected to provide utility for further\\nresearch. Second, the wide coverage of happiness strategies\\nallowed us the opportunity to evaluate the entire array of inten-\\ntional behaviors used to promote personal happiness. The\\nanalyses reveal the predictive power of individual happiness-CHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 218increasing strategies, happiness strategies taken as a set, and\\nhappiness strategies while controlling for traits. Finally, and\\nmost important, this study takes a step toward investigating the\\ncomplex interplay between traits and well-being. Overall, the\\nstudy highlights the importance of the behaviors that people use\\nto bolster happiness and suggests that theories of happiness\\nshould take personality traits and intentional activities into ac-\\ncount.\\nA further limitation is our use of the Subjective Happiness\\nScale (Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999) as the sole criterion of\\nthe happiness strategies’ eﬀectiveness. However, we are encour-\\naged by ﬁndings that employing the Satisfaction With Life Scale\\n(Diener et al., 1985) as the criterion yielded very similar results.\\nFuture studies should assess the potential beneﬁts, other than\\nhappiness and satisfaction, gained by engaging in happiness-\\nenhancing strategies – for example, social rewards, academic\\nand career success, wisdom and insight, and psychological\\ngrowth and maturity (see Lyubomirsky et al., in press, for a\\nreview).\\nSelf-Report Biases\\nAll studies that involve subjective ratings face concerns about\\nthe interpretations made by the respondents. For example, we\\ncannot know exactly how the participants made their judgments\\nregarding the frequency of their happiness-promoting behaviors.\\nStudents were asked to rate how often they performed the spec-\\niﬁed strategy on a scale ranging from never toall the time . This\\njudgment is inherently subjective. For those who are low in\\nmotivation, all the time could have meant that they consciously\\nperformed the strategy once a week. In contrast, highly moti-\\nvated students could have interpreted all the time as meaning\\nseveral times a day. Future research could address this issue by\\nproviding more objective anchors for the responses – for exam-\\nple, a scale ranging from never tomore than once a day. Ulti-\\nmately, what is needed is to objectively quantify actual\\nbehaviors and assess how they relate to happiness. It is hoped\\nthat the present study can provide a guide to which behaviors\\nshould be targeted for future research.HOW DO PEOPLE PURSUE HAPPINESS ? 219Another concern is that we cannot be certain whether the\\nrespondents interpreted ‘‘happiness’’ as a global, enduring con-\\ndition with long-term implications, or as a ﬂeeting mood. A\\nperusal of the items drawn from the pilot study suggests that\\nthe term happiness was interpreted as both. For example, the\\nitems ‘‘study’’ and ‘‘work’’ undoubtedly imply that the respon-\\ndents were considering long-term beneﬁts, rather than short-\\nterm affect boosts. By contrast, the strategies of ‘‘partying’’ and\\n‘‘drinking alcohol’’ appeared to be directed at temporary mood\\nchange and not lifelong happiness.\\nFinally, because participants were questioned about what\\nthey did to ‘‘maintain or increase’’ their happiness, we do not\\nknow which strategies they were using in order to maintain or\\npreserve their happiness vs. to promote or maximize it. To ad-\\ndress this limitation, future researchers could ask both sets of\\nquestions separately or, alternatively, consider using experience\\nsampling methodology to assess brief, sequential moments of\\nmood and behavior.\\nSampling Issues\\nAlthough the study’s sample was ethnically diverse, it was\\ndrawn from a population of students that is relatively homoge-\\nneous with regard to age, socioeconomic status, and occupa-\\ntional status; consequently, generalization of our ﬁndings is\\nnecessarily limited. Future researchers might consider recruiting\\nmore heterogeneous samples. We expect, however, that,\\nalthough the speciﬁcs of happiness-increasing strategies may dif-\\nfer across segments of the population, the overall strategies\\nwould take a similar form. For example, a truck driver from\\nMontana is unlikely to list ‘‘study’’ and ‘‘get good grades’’ as\\nways to boost his happiness. Nevertheless, he may list other\\nactivities that correspond to Instrumental Goal Pursuit.\\nA related priority for future research should be to investigate\\nhappiness-increasing strategies in different cultures. Research\\nsuggests that the very nature of ‘‘ideal’’ happiness may vary\\nacross cultures (Lyubomirsky, 1997; Tsai et al., in press).\\nConsequently, strategies used to promote happiness may diﬀer\\nin their character and frequency of use in diverse cultural\\ncontexts.CHRIS TKACH AND SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY 220CONCLUDING REMARK\\nWe believe the take-home message of this research to be a\\npositive one. The ﬁndings show that traits alone do not fully\\naccount for levels of happiness. People are notgenetically\\ndestined to experience a predetermined amount of happiness,\\nvolitional behaviors do matter, and ﬁnding happiness may be\\nas simple as ﬁnding the right happiness strategy.\\nNOTES\\n1The one exception to this rule was that ‘‘draw’’ was excluded from the\\naverage for Social Aﬃliation on theoretical grounds.\\n2Although not reported, parallel correlation and regression analyses were per-\\nformed with the Satisfaction With Life Scale (Diener et al., 1985) as the\\ncriterion. The results were similar to those found for the SHS, with one excep-\\ntion – Instrumental Goal Pursuit was a better predictor of life satisfaction than\\nof happiness.\\n3Z was calculated using Baron and Kenny’s (1986) formula.\\n4Prior to performing the SEM analyses, univariate analyses revealed that\\nonly three items were skewed – the largest skew equaling )1.55 (kurto-\\nsis=3.07). Following transformation, parallel analyses were performed on\\nthe transformed data. The results were nearly identical to those with the un-\\ntransformed data; thus, the untransformed results are presented here.\\nREFERENCES\\nAdams, V.H., III: 1997, /C212A Paradox in African American Quality of Life /C213,\\nSocial Indicators Research 42, pp. 205–219.\\nAllport, G.W.: 1955, Becoming: Basic Considerations for a Psychology of\\nPersonality (Yale University Press, New Haven, CT, US).\\nAnshensel, C.S. and G.J.

Ten years ago, the landmark Stiglitz-Sen-Fitousi\\nCommission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress was pivotal inbringing the issue of happiness to public attention (136). This inquiry, led by economists, co-\\ngently exposed the limitations of conventional indicators of economic performance as measures\\nofsocialprogressandarguedthatsubjectivewell-beingshouldbetakenintoaccountaswell.TheUnitedNations(UN)GeneralAssemblyresolvedin2011toinviteallmembercountriestomea-\\nsurehappinessanduseittohelpguidepublicpolicy;theAssemblyinitiatedtheWorldHappiness\\nReport,whichprovidesanannualleaguetableofhappinessacrosscountriesandstimulatesmuchcompetitive interest in national mass media (54). Positive psychology has become a recognized\\nsubdiscipline, with professional learned societies, journals, and postgraduate degrees from uni-\\nversities in the United States,the United Kingdom,Canada,Australia,Denmark,Singapore,andother countries.Numerous general interest books by economists and psychologists have extolled\\nthe value of happiness (33, 36, 48, 80, 84), and life coaching for happiness is a thriving industry.\\nThis attention has, in turn, led to skeptical reactions from many quarters (32, 41). Nowhere hasthecontroversybeengreaterthaninthehealtharena:BarbaraEhrenreich’s Bright-Sided.Howthe\\nRelentlessPromotionofPositiveThinkingHasUnderminedAmerica (tellingly retitled SmileorDie in\\nthe United Kingdom) took particular aim at claims that happiness is related to physical health\\n(38).\\nCommonexperiencetellsusthatwhenpeoplesufferfromaseriousillnessorareinpain,their\\ncapacity for happiness is impaired. But beyond this, why is it interesting or useful to study hap-\\npiness and health? A substantial body of evidence relating depression and distress with ill-health\\nalreadyexists.Longitudinalpopulationstudieshavedocumentedassociationsbetweentheseneg-ative psychological states and incident coronary heart disease (CHD) (24), stroke (82) and type\\n2 diabetes (50),whereas depression predicts increased mortality among people with documented\\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, CHD, stroke, and some cancers (3, 5, 89, 106,109). If positive well-being merely reflects the absence of depression and distress, do studies of\\nhappiness break any new ground?\\nThisreviewproposestwomajorreasonsfortakinghappinessseriouslyinthecontextofhealth.\\nThefirstreasonisthattheabsenceofnegativestatessuchasdepressionanddistressdoesnotmean\\nthatapersonishappy.Theindividualmightbeinanaffectivelyneutralstate,perhapsnotexperi-\\nencingdistressbutnotfeelingparticularlyhappyeither.Additionally,moodsfluctuaterapidly,andmany experiences are bittersweet,eliciting both positive and negative feelings (78).Several stud-\\nies have documented links between happiness and health that are maintained even after negative\\nemotions are taken into account, which implies that associations between happiness and healthmay be distinctive.\\nThesecondreasonforinvestigatinghappinessandhealthisbecauseofthepotentialforinter-\\nvention. Techniques are being developed to improve positive well-being and cultivate happiness\\nthat are different from those used to combat depression and distress. If happiness is protective,\\nthen interventions targeting well-being may have a favorable impact on public health.\\nThis article summarizes the epidemiological evidence for the relationship between happiness\\nand mortality and morbidity, focusing particularly on physical health outcomes. The behavioral\\nand biological pathways that may link happiness with health are outlined, and interventions de-signed to promote happiness are reviewed. I argue that although the wilder claims of happiness\\ngurus should be treated with suspicion,genuine associations between happiness and good health\\nneed to be unpacked and evaluated in the context of individual and population health.\\n340 SteptoeDownloaded from www.annualreviews.org.

In his Nicomachean Ethics , Aristotle favored eudaimonia, or living well and\\npurposefully, over the vulgar pleasure seeking of hedonism.

A growing literature relates optimism with disease risk, prognosis, health\\nbehaviors,andbiologicalprocesses(65,85,114).Unfortunately,spacelimitationsprohibitdiscus-sion of optimism in this article.\\nMeasurement is an important issue in health research.

But retrospective ratings may not accurately reflect actual experience\\nbecause of failures in recall,recency biases,and other factors (62).Alternative methods based onecological momentary assessment (EMA), diary methods, and the Day Reconstruction Method\\n(a technique for measuring the moods associated with recent activities) have been applied in the\\nhealth context (28,133).Such methods have improved the precision of measuring affective well-being by asking people to report about brief recent periods, exploring emotional states directly\\nwithout the overlay of retrospective evaluation (73).\\nThe assessment of eudaimonic well-being requires more extensive cognitive processing than\\ndo ratings of current feelings and involves relatively complex introspection about attributes ag-\\ngregated over time. The same applies to measures of evaluative well-being. Investigators have\\ndeveloped several questionnaire measures of these aspects of subjective well-being, some withfixed time frames (e.g., the past few weeks), whereas others are more open-ended (34, 118).

Some researchers argue\\nthat single measures,such as assessments of life satisfaction,are sufficient for the investigation ofhappiness (26, 80). However, there are potentially important differences in the biological corre-\\nlates of the three dimensions of subjective well-being,and implications for intervention may also\\ndiffer. So, in the context of health studies, consideration of distinct types of well-being may beimportant.\\nA wide array of factors appears to contribute to subjective well-being.

These results are corroborated by a\\nseparate meta-analysis of studies focused on purpose in life (27).Associations have been reportedboth in men and women and in samples recruited in the United States and Canada, in several\\ncountries in Europe, and in Pacific Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan\\n(29, 45, 70–72). Follow-up periods have ranged from 2 years to more than 20 years. Most mor-tality research has inevitably involved tracking middle-aged and older people; studies of younger\\nindividuals have limited power because of lower event rates. Some investigations have involved\\nyoungeraswellasolderindividuals,however,andhaveshownprotectiveassociations(55);effectsare also present in the very old (39).\\nMany analyses have involved aggregate measures that incorporate different aspects of well-\\nbeing (64,74,145),and few have directly contrasted different types of subjective well-being (45,\\n86). Nonetheless, associations with mortality have been observed with distinct measures of af-\\nfective and evaluative well-being (17,75,125,134) and with various aspects of eudaimonic well-being (55, 128, 139). Most researchers have assessed happiness by questionnaire, asking respon-\\ndents about their experiences over the past week or month or more generally. Evidence has also\\nindicated that more positive mood states measured through EMA are associated with reducedmortality(133).The vast majorityof studieshave assessedwell-beingon a singleoccasion,which\\ncould be affected by transient recent experiences.But duration of effects has been investigated as\\nwell: Individuals who report greater well-being on repeated measures over four years have lowermortality than do those who report greater well-being on only one occasion (149).\\nAnimportantissueexploredinsomeofthesestudiesiswhethertheprotectiveeffectofgreater\\nsubjective well-being is independent of negative emotional states of depression or distress.

For example, an analysis of the National Health and\\nNutrition Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study found that enjoyment of life was associated with re-duced all-cause mortality over 10 years among individuals with diabetes after adjusting for age,\\nethnicity,self-ratedhealth,andphysicalactivity(94).Nonetheless,prognosticstudiesaredifficult\\nto interpret in the absence of strong measures of baseline illness severity.Sicker people are morelikely to have a poor prognosis and may also report less happiness, perhaps because they have\\nmore severe symptoms or have more pessimistic communication with health professionals.This\\nscenariocouldleadtospuriousassociationsbetweenhappinessandprognosis.Suchprocessesaredifficult to evaluate in the absence of detailed evidence of health status and patient perceptions.\\nPATHWAYS RELATING HAPPINESS WITH HEALTH\\nAssumingthatrobustlinksexistbetweenhappinessandhealth,twopathwayshavebeenproposed.The first is that habitual behavioral practices link the two and that people with greater subjectivewell-beinghavehealthylifestylesthatreducetheirriskofmorbidityandprematuremortality.The\\nsecondisthatbiologicalcorrelatesofhappinesscanmediatetheassociationwithhealthoutcomes.\\nBehavioral Processes\\nAswillbeapparentfromearliersections,associationsbetweenhappinessandhealtharefrequently\\nsomewhat attenuated when health behaviors are taken into account, implying that these factors\\nplayanimportantmediatingrole.Buthowmuchevidenceistherethatfavorablehealthbehaviors\\nare associated with happiness?

A study from\\nDenmark followed 607 patients with CHD over 5 years (57).Positive affect predicted lower all-\\ncause mortality, as did greater physical activity. Positive affect was also associated with physicalactivity,and when activity was entered into the statistical models,the relationship between well-\\nbeingandmortalitywasnolongersignificant.Similarly,ananalysisoftheHeartandSoulStudyof\\npatientswith stableCHD foundthat greater positiveaffect was associated with reduced all-cause\\nmortality over an average of seven years (56). This relationship remained significant after con-\\ntrolling for cardiac disease severity and depression but was eliminated by accounting for physicalactivity.\\nLinks between diet and subjective well-being have also been explored,given longitudinal evi-\\ndence that poor diets are associated with future depression (81).Intriguing associations betweenthe consumption of fruit and vegetables and subjective well-being have been reported in both\\ncross-sectionalandlongitudinalpopulationstudies(11,95).Butashort-terminterventiontrialof\\nenhancing fruit and vegetable intake was inconclusive (30).\\nTherehasalsobeenworkrelatinglowlifesatisfactiontoexcessivealcoholconsumption,smok-\\ning,and failure to use sun protection (49),though the importance of these associations to health\\noutcomesisunclear.Anotherfacetofhealthbehaviorthatmayberelevantistheuseofpreventivecare services. An analysis of the Health and Retirement Study demonstrated that greater eudai-\\nmonia (purpose in life) was associated with an increased likelihood of having cholesterol tests,\\ncolonoscopy, mammograms, and Papanicolaou tests (women) and prostate examinations (men)(68).These associations were independent of age,ethnicity,marital status,education,wealth,in-\\nsurance states,and chronic illness.Greater purpose in life was associated with fewer nights spent\\nin the hospital as well. These findings point to potentially important ways in which the lifestyle\\ncorrelates of subjective well-being may contribute to positive health outcomes.\\nHappiness and Biological Processes\\nEarlystudiesrelatinghappinesswithbiologicalprocessesrelevanttohealthofteninvolvedcollege\\nstudents and small sample sizes (112).

Second are inter-\\nventions that impact happiness but not necessarily as the primary outcome and that may have\\nindependent effects on health. Examples include enhancing physical activity or increasing socialactivity (40, 97).

Fully understanding the bidirec-tional associations between happiness and health involves the integration of epidemiological\\nresearch with clinical, biobehavioral, and experimental work.

Firm conclusions would be strengthened by controlled\\ninterventionstudiesdemonstratingthatchangesinhappinessresultinchangesinhealth,butsuch\\na program would require longitudinal trials involving robust methods of modifying subjective\\nwell-being over prolonged periods. In the meantime, research on causality has not yet exploited\\nmethods such as instrumental variable approaches, natural experiments, and negative control\\nstudies that might produce more compelling findings than those emerging from observationalwork (79).

Easterlin*\\nDepartment of Economics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0253\\nThis contribution is part of the special series of Inaugural Articles by members of the National Academy of Sciences elected on April 30, 2002.Contributed by Richard A. Easterlin, May 23, 2003\\nWhat do social survey data tell us about the determinants of\\nhappiness? First, that the psychologists’ setpoint model is ques-tionable. Life events in the nonpecuniary domain, such as mar-riage, divorce, and serious disability, have a lasting effect onhappiness, and do not simply deﬂect the average person tempo-rarily above or below a setpoint given by genetics and personality.Second, mainstream economists’ inference that in the pecuniarydomain ‘‘more is better,’’ based on revealed preference theory, isproblematic. An increase in income, and thus in the goods at one’sdisposal, does not bring with it a lasting increase in happinessbecause of the negative effect on utility of hedonic adaptation andsocial comparison. A better theory of happiness builds on theevidence that adaptation and social comparison affect utility lessin the nonpecuniary than pecuniary domains. Because individualsfail to anticipate the extent to which adaptation and social com-parison undermine expected utility in the pecuniary domain, theyallocate an excessive amount of time to pecuniary goals, andshortchange nonpecuniary ends such as family life and health,reducing their happiness. There is need to devise policies that willyield better-informed individual preferences, and thereby increaseindividual and societal well-being.\\nliving level /H20841health /H20841marital status /H20841aspirations\\nItake the terms happiness, utility, well-being, life satisfaction,\\nand welfare to be interchangeable and measured by the answer\\nto a question such as that asked since 1972 in the United StatesGeneral Social Survey (GSS): ‘‘Taken all together, how wouldyou say things are these days—would you say that you are veryhappy, pretty happy, or not too happy?’’ A substantial method-ological literature has developed on the reliability, validity, andcomparability of the answers to such questions (1–4). Theconsensus is that the responses, although not without theirproblems, are meaningful and reasonably comparable amonggroups of individuals. I focus here on the determinants ofhappiness, so measured.\\nMy point of departure is the prevailing theories of well-being\\nin psychology and economics. This is not to suggest that there isunanimity in either field; the theories discussed below are whatone might view as the central tendency of each discipline. I tryto take advantage of work in both fields plus social survey datato suggest the shape of a theory that is more consistent with whatpeople say about how happy they feel.\\nIn psychology, the tendency is toward ‘‘setpoint theory’’ (refs.\\n5–8; see ref. 9 for a good overview). Each individual is thoughtto have a setpoint of happiness given by genetics and personality.Life events, such as marriage, loss of a job, and serious injury ordisease, may deflect a person above or below this setpoint, butin time hedonic adaptation will return an individual to the initiallevel. One setpoint theory writer states flatly that objective lifecircumstances have a negligible role to play in a theory ofhappiness (ref. 10, p. 18).\\nIf the goal of public action is to improve well-being, this theory\\nimplies that economic and social policy is futile. Any measuretaken to improve economic or social conditions can have only atransient effect on well-being, because each individual will intime revert to his or her given setpoint of happiness (see ref. 11,p. 227). Moreover, if setpoint theory is correct, not only is publicpolicy likely to be ineffective, but there is little an individual can\\ndo to improve his or her well-being, except, perhaps, consult apsychologist.\\nIn contrast, in economics, life circumstances, and particularly\\ngrowth of income, are believed to have lasting effects onhappiness. The prevailing theory might be termed ‘‘more isbetter.’’ As a general matter, economists prefer not to theorizeabout subjective states of mind and to deal only with observedbehavior. Their argument, termed ‘‘revealed preference,’’ is thatif an individual is observed to buy a certain combination ofgoods, say x\\n2,y2, when an alternative combination, x1,y1,i s\\naffordable with that person’s given income and the prevailingprices, then (based on certain axioms) the individual is deemedto prefer x\\n2,y2tox1,y1and hence, to be better off (12, 13). A\\nmajor implication of this theory is that one can improve well-being by increasing one’s own income, and that policy measuresaimed at increasing the income of society as a whole lead togreater well-being. Economists recognize that happiness de-pends on a variety of circumstances besides material conditions,but they have long assumed that if income increases substan-tially, then overall well-being will move in the same direction(ref. 14, p. 3).\\nIn what follows, I argue that neither the prevailing psycho-\\nlogical nor economic theories are consistent with accumulatingsurvey evidence on happiness, and based on this analysis, I tryto sketch the outlines of a better theory. My empirical worktakes, for the most part, a life cycle approach, applying thedemographer’s technique of cohort analysis to survey data. Inthis procedure, the same group of persons (a birth cohort) issampled from one year to the next as it moves through adult-hood. Generalizations about life cycle experience are obtainedhere by following each of several cohorts over the 28-year spanbetween 1972 and 2000 covered by the GSS. Because some\\ncohorts are at the beginning of the adult life cycle in 1972,whereas others are in their middle or later years, it is possible toinfer patterns over the full adult life span by bringing together thedifferent segments of life cycle experience represented byyounger and older cohorts. The total sample size of the annualsurveys is typically /H110151,500, except after 1994 when they are\\nalmost twice as great. I sometimes use 3- or 5-year averages tominimize the problem of small sample size that arises when onesubdivides the total sample by characteristics such as age,gender, health, and marital or work status. The three-optionhappiness question, when it is used, is scaled from 3 /H11005very happy\\nto 1/H11005not too happy, to compute mean happiness for various\\npopulation subgroups.\\nIs There a Setpoint of Happiness?\\nLet me start with the psychological theory. The critical issue here\\nis not whether any adaptation to life events occurs, but whetheradaptation is complete, that is, whether individuals return totheir initial level of happiness, and, if so, how quickly. There arepsychological studies that make clear that, with respect to\\nAbbreviation: GSS, General Social Survey.\\n*E-mail: easterl@usc.edu.© 2003 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA\\n11176–11183 /H20841PNAS /H20841September 16, 2003 /H20841vol. 100 /H20841no. 19 www.pnas.org /H20862cgi/H20862doi /H2086210.1073 /H20862pnas.1633144100\\nDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 119.246.96.113 on November 10, 2024 from IP address 119.246.96.113.\\nexperiences such as loud noise and cosmetic surgery, hedonic\\nadaptation is typically less than complete, and that these expe-riences have a lasting effect on people ’s well-being (15). The\\nsurvey evidence presented below suggests, in addition, thatindividuals do not fully adapt to changes in either health ormarital circumstances. Needless to say, I am speaking of averageeffects; there is considerable dispersion about the mean.\\nHealth and Happiness. The seminal article repeatedly cited in the\\npsychology literature as demonstrating complete adaptation toadverse changes in health is a 1978 study (16) that reports thatserious accident victims (paraplegics and quadriplegics), num-bering 29, when compared with a group of controls, numbering22,‘‘did not appear nearly as unhappy as might have been\\nexpected ’’(ref. 16, p. 921). The sample size in this study is very\\nsmall, but in any event, the study does not find that accidentvictims are as happy as controls. On the contrary, accidentvictims, compared with controls, ‘‘rated themselves significantly\\nless happy ’’(ref. 16, p. 924). Setpoint (or ‘‘adaptation level ’’)\\ntheory is saved only by introducing a quite different comparison,one between accident victims and an unspecified ‘‘what might\\nhave been expected. ’’\\nThere have been a number of studies since, some supporting\\nthe notion of complete adaptation, others contradicting it. To myknowledge, the most comprehensive investigation is, like the oneabove, a point-of-time study (17). It examines the life satisfaction(on a 5-point scale) of a national sample of 675 persons reportingdisabling conditions and compares them with a national sampleof/H110221,000 nondisabled persons. This study finds that the life\\nsatisfaction of those with disabilities is, on average, significantlyless than those who report no disabilities (ref. 17, p. 13).Moreover, persons with disabilities are classified in various ways:according to the severity of the disability, whether the respon-dent suffers from one or multiple conditions, to what extent therespondent is limited in daily activities, and whether close othersare thought to perceive the respondent as disabled. On every oneof these dimensions, happiness is less for those with more seriousproblems (ref. 17, pp. 10 –12).\\nA question is sometimes raised as to which way the causal\\narrow runs: from health to life satisfaction or life satisfaction tohealth? If health is conceived unidimensionally, a plausible apriori argument can be made that life satisfaction affects health,\\nas well as vice versa. But when health is characterized multidi-mensionally, as in this study, the plausible inference is thatgreater health problems result systematically in less happiness.\\nThese results suggest that, on average, an adverse change in\\nhealth reduces life satisfaction, and the worse the change inhealth, the greater the reduction in life satisfaction. The resultsdo not mean that no adaptation to disability occurs. The initialimpact on happiness, say, of an accident or serious disease, is nodoubt greater than its long-term impact. Adjustment to adisabling condition may be facilitated by health devices such ashearing aids, medications, or wheelchairs, and by a supportnetwork of friends and relatives. Moreover, the extent of adap-tation may vary depending on the personality or other charac-teristics of the individual affected. But the evidence does suggestthat, even with adaptation, there is, on average, a lasting negativeeffect on happiness of an adverse change in health.\\nLet me turn from health at a point in time to some life cycle\\nevidence. There is no question that, among adults, real healthproblems increase as people age. But what do persons say abouttheir health? If adaptation were complete to adverse changes in\\nhealth, then the life course trend in self-reported health shouldbe flat. It would also be flat if persons implicitly evaluate theirhealth only by comparison with others of their age. Is it true thatself-reported health does not change?\\nThe answer is no, self-reported health declines throughout the\\nlife course. Since 1972, the GSS has asked the following question:‘‘Would you say your own health, in general, is excellent, good,\\nfair, or poor? ’’(ref. 18, p. 172). If one follows successively older\\n10-year birth cohorts for 28-year segments of the life span, onefinds for each cohort a clear (and statistically significant) down-trend in mean self-reported health (Fig. 1). (The mean healthrating is obtained by scaling the responses from excellent /H110054\\ndown to poor /H110051.) In the two oldest cohorts, those in their sixties\\nand seventies, the apparent leveling off of self-reported health isdue to the truncation of the sample caused by mortality; thosereporting poorer health do, in fact, die more rapidly (20, 21). Theconclusion suggested by the data on self-reported health is thesame as that for the preceding data on disability. There is notcomplete hedonic adaptation to adverse changes in health.\\nThis analysis, of course, assesses adaptation in terms of\\n Fig. 1. Mean self-reported health, cohorts of 1911–1920 to 1951–1960, by age. Five-year average is centered at each age. Data are from ref. 19.\\nEasterlin PNAS /H20841September 16, 2003 /H20841vol. 100 /H20841no. 19 /H2084111177\\nSOCIAL SCIENCES\\nDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 119.246.96.113 on November 10, 2024 from IP address 119.246.96.113.\\nself-reported health, not well-being, as in the disability analysis.\\nPerhaps health might get worse, but people do not feel unhappyabout it. Throughout the life cycle, however, those who reportthey are less healthy also say they are less happy. In cohortsspanning ages from the twenties through the seventies, happinessis systematically less, on average, the poorer the state of self-reported health (Table 1). This is consistent with the resultsabove on how life satisfaction is related to various disablingconditions and with numerous multivariate studies that findsignificant positive associations between happiness and self-reported health (2, 3, 22 –24). These studies, which, among other\\nthings, control for income, make clear that the negative impactof poorer health on happiness is caused by nonpecuniary effectsas well as loss of income due to poor health. The conclusion towhich all of these findings consistently lead is that adverse healthchanges have a lasting and negative effect on happiness, and thatthere is less than complete adaptation to deteriorating health.\\nMarital Status and Happiness. Despite claims by setpoint theory\\nproponents that life circumstances have virtually no lasting effecton well-being, little evidence on marital formation or dissolutionsupporting setpoint theory has been advanced. There is, how-ever, one important new study, using German longitudinal data,that examines the effects on well-being of marriage and widow-hood (9). Although presented as a critique of the setpoint model,\\nit is actually supportive, especially as regards marriage, becauseit concludes: ‘‘[O]n average, people adapt quickly and com-\\npletely to marriage, and they adapt more slowly to widowhood(although even in this case, adaptation is close to complete afterabout 8 years) ’’(ref. 9, p. 538).\\nStudy of the life cycle experience of cohorts, however, suggests\\na substantial departure from the setpoint model. At ages 18 –19,\\nwhen most women and virtually all men have not yet married,their mean happiness is /H110152.1; over the next 10 years, as up to\\n50% or more of a cohort becomes married, those who aremarried report significantly higher happiness levels, on average,/H110152.2–2.3, whereas those who have never married remain at /H110152.1.\\n(See Fig. 2 for females; the pattern for males is quite similar.)\\nThese results cannot be due to selection effects. Persons who\\nmarry in the first decade of the adult life cycle could not havebeen happier than others, on average, before they got married.If this were true, then as these persons married and left thenever-married group, the average happiness of the remainingnever-married would fall. In fact, the happiness of those never-married remains constant as more and more persons marry andexit the group (Fig. 2). As a result, the mean happiness of thecohort as a whole increases as the proportion married increases;note in Fig. 2 that the curve for all persons starts close to 2.1 andends above 2.2.\\nBeyond age 30, the proportion of a cohort currently married\\ntends to level off and then decline as the effect of maritaldissolution due to divorce, separation, and widowhood graduallyoutweighs that due to the formation of unions through marriageand remarriage. Throughout the adult life cycle, however, the\\ngap in average happiness persists between those who are cur-rently married and those who are not. (See Fig. 3 for females; the\\npattern for males is again similar).\\nRemarriage has the same positive effect on happiness as a first\\nmarriage. When the cohort data for married persons in Fig. 3 aredivided between those who are still in their first marriage andthose who are remarried, there is no significant difference inhappiness between the two groups. If respondents are askedspecifically about their marital satisfaction, rather than overallhappiness, it is again true that those who are remarried are, onaverage, as satisfied with their marriage as those still in their firstmarriage.\\nComparisons across cohorts suggest that happiness does not\\ndecline with duration of marriage. For those still in their firstmarriage, the average length of marriage ranges from /H1101510 years\\nor less in the cohort of 1951 –1960 to /H1102235 years in the cohort of\\n1921 –1930. (Duration of marriage for remarried persons is not\\navailable in the GSS data.) The mean level of both overallhappiness and marital happiness for these two cohorts is virtuallythe same despite their much different marriage durations, and issignificantly greater than that of unmarried persons in theircohorts.\\nNone of these life cycle marriage patterns squares easily with\\nthe notion that married persons are reverting ‘‘quickly and\\ncompletely ’’to their average level of happiness before marriage.\\nAs a cohort enters into marriage, the happiness of marriedpersons is significantly greater than the unmarried and, ifanything, increasing. Throughout the life cycle, the happiness ofmarried persons, whether remarried or continuously married,remains significantly higher than others. Moreover, even after 35years of marriage, the happiness of those still in their firstmarriage remains significantly greater than that of their unmar-ried counterparts.\\nJust as marriage affects happiness positively, the dissolution of\\nmarriage has a negative impact. As has been seen, the meanhappiness of women not currently married is significantly belowthat of their married counterparts. Within the unmarried group,however, those with broken marriages, that is, the divorced,separated, or widowed, are significantly less happy than thosewho never married (Table 2). One might speculate that person-ality has sorted out those who are divorced or separated, butthere is no significant happiness difference between them andthose who are widowed. The widowed are unlikely to have beenselected on the basis of personality, and the fact that their meanhappiness and that of the divorced or separated group is virtuallythe same suggests that one is observing here the effect of maritalTable 1.

In contrast,mean happiness among those who separated or divorced and did\\nnot remarry is significantly less than that of those who married.\\nThese life cycle results on marital status and happiness from\\nboth cohort analysis and panel data are consistent with crosssectional regression analyses of the marriage-happiness relation-ship in which controls are introduced for a variety of socio-economic circumstances (2, 3, 22, 23), and with other studies thatfocus on specific marital conditions such as divorce or widow-hood (26, 27). The study of German data (9) cited at thebeginning of this section that concludes that people adapt tomarriage ‘‘quickly and completely ’’is at variance with this\\nsizeable body of evidence. It is contradicted specifically by thecohort patterns in the American data presented here, becausethe findings of the German study imply that the mean happinessof married persons would decrease as a cohort enters intomarriage. To see this, let t\\nobe the year of marriage. The German\\nstudy finds a temporary elevation in life satisfaction from t/H110021\\ntot/H110011, but that mean life satisfaction at t/H110012 and thereafter\\nreverts to its average at t/H110022 and before. For simplicity, suppose\\nthat the pattern in the German study characterized all personsin a cohort as they aged from 18, when none was married, to 29,when half were married. Then the initial life satisfaction ofmarried persons in the cohort would be at its maximum value,\\nbecause all of them would be in the honeymoon period at t\\noand\\nt/H110011. In subsequent years, however, the honeymoon happiness\\nof those newly marrying would be increasingly offset by thereturn to their t/H110022 level of those in the cohort who were married\\nfirst, and the average life satisfaction of married persons as awhole would trend downward. Such a decline for marriedpersons does not occur in the cohort data studied here for eitherfemales (Fig. 2) or males.\\nI do not know why the analysis of German data yields\\ncontradictory results; but it is worth noting that the study, thoughdrawing on longitudinal data, does not actually follow the sameindividuals over time. Although there is overlap, the threegroups that are the basis of the statistical analysis (the ‘‘honey-\\nmoon ’’group at t/H110021t o t/H110011, those at t/H110012 and thereafter, and\\nthose at t/H110022 and before) are not the same in their composition.\\nIn sum, the bulk of evidence suggests that the formation of\\nunions has a lasting positive effect on happiness, whereasdissolution has a permanently negative effect. This does notmean that no adaptation occurs after unions are formed ordissolved, but the adaptation that occurs is less than complete.If the setpoint model of happiness is correct, it is hard to see howone can reconcile it with the survey evidence on marriage, as wellas health.\\nNote should be made of other GSS evidence on happiness that\\nis difficult to square with the setpoint model. Throughout the life\\ncycle, blacks are consistently less happy than whites (28). It seemsdoubtful that this difference by race is a result simply of differentaverage setpoints resulting from genetic and personality differ-ences. Also, beyond age 60, the life cycle excess of female overmale happiness is reversed; it is hard to explain this withoutreference to differences by gender in the incidence of life events,especially widowhood, after age 60 (29).\\nIs More Better?\\nTo turn to economic theory, a basic problem with the revealed\\npreference approach is that the judgment on a person ’s happi-\\nness is made, not by the individual concerned, but by an outsiderwho is observing the person ’s consumption choices (30). If one\\ntakes the view that the only one who can make authoritativejudgments on a person ’s feelings of well-being is the person\\nconcerned, then one is led to look at self-reports on well-being.\\nDoes the survey evidence support the view that income and\\nhappiness go together? The answer depends on whether one\\nFig. 3. Mean happiness of currently married and unmarried females in speciﬁed birth cohort, by age. Five-year average is centered at each age.

Support for the\\nhypothesis of a positive association comes from point-of-timeregressions, which invariably find a significant positive associa-tion between income and happiness, with or without controls forother factors (2, 3, 22, 23, 31). Over the life cycle, however, asincome increases and then levels off, happiness remains un-changed, contradicting the inference that income and well-beinggo together (32, 33).\\nIf one uses education as a proxy for income, then the life cycle\\ndata reveal both of these relationships. At any given age, thosewith more education are happier than those with less (Fig. 4; seeref. 33 for other cohorts). What is even more noteworthy,however, is the life cycle trend in happiness for the more and lesseducated. If happiness were moving in accordance with theincome of each group, then the happiness of both groups wouldincrease, with that of the better educated increasing more, andthe happiness differential by educational status widening. In fact,there is no significant trend in happiness for either educational\\ngroup, or in the happiness differential (33). Although thosefortunate enough to start out with higher income and educationremain, on average, happier throughout the life cycle than thoseof lower socioeconomic status, there is no evidence for eithergroup that happiness increases with income.\\nThese life cycle patterns clearly contradict the expectation\\nbased on economic theory that happiness increases with income.They do, however, support the setpoint model; indeed, thesefindings have appropriately been cited by psychologists in sup-port of complete hedonic adaptation. But although there may becomplete hedonic adaptation with regard to income, this doesnot mean that there is complete adaptation with regard to allsources of happiness. As has been seen, the evidence on healthand marriage suggests that adaptation in these areas is less thancomplete, and that changes in these circumstances have a lastingeffect on well-being.\\nAspirations and Adaptation\\nWhy should the extent of adaptation differ with regard to the life\\ncircumstances, or, as psychologists say, ‘‘domain, ’’under study?\\nThe answer, I suggest, is that people ’s aspirations in each domain\\nrespond differently to changes in their circumstances. Completeadaptation implies that aspirations change to the same extent asone’s actual circumstances. This seems to be what happens when\\nincome changes. Material aspirations increase commensuratelywith income, and, as a result, one gets no nearer to or fartheraway from the attainment of one ’s material goals, and well-being\\nis unchanged. Less than complete adaptation means that aspi-rations change less than the actual change in one ’s circum-\\nstances. If one ’s actual circumstances change for the better (a\\nhappy marriage), there is greater goal-fulfillment and well-beingincreases; if one ’s circumstances change for the worse (divorce),\\nthere is a greater shortfall from one ’s goals, and well-being\\ndeclines. This seems to be what happens in the marriage andhealth domains.Is there evidence that the response of aspirations to actual\\ncircumstances varies by domain? For the economic and familydomains, the answer is yes. In what follows, I draw chiefly onnationally representative surveys taken in 1978 and 1994 thatinclude questions on the ‘‘good life ’’(34, 35). In these surveys the\\nquestioning procedure is as follows:\\n1. We often hear people talk about what they want out of life.\\nHere are a number of different things. [The respondent ishanded a card with a list of 24 items.] When you think of thegood life, the life you ’d like to have, which of the things on this\\nlist, if any, are part of that good life as far as you personallyare concerned?\\n2. Now, would you go down that list and call off all of the things\\nyou now have?\\nThe special value of these two questions is that they yield\\ninformation rarely available, on both aspirations and the attain-ment of aspirations. The answers to question 1 tell us about\\ndesires for certain goods and also for marriage and a family,whether they are viewed as part of the good life, ‘‘the life you ’d\\nlike to have. ’’Those to question 2 tell us where the respondents\\nstand in relation to these desires, that is, to what extent they arefulfilled. By comparing a cohort ’s aspirations and attainments in\\n1978 and 1994, it is possible to determine to what extentaspirations change in both the material goods and family do-mains as a cohort ’s actual circumstances change.\\nLet me start with 10 big-ticket consumer goods that are\\nincluded on the ‘‘good life ’’list, ranging from a home, car, and\\ntelevision set to travel abroad, a swimming pool, and a vacationhome. Over each stage of the life cycle people typically acquiremore of these big-ticket items (Table 3, goods owned). But theiraspirations for these goods (what they view as part of the goodlife) also rise (Table 3, goods desired). Moreover, the increase inthe number of goods desired is, on average, roughly equal inmagnitude to that in the average number owned (Table 3,bottom).\\nWhat is happening is that as people acquire those goods for\\nwhich aspirations were fairly high to start with (a home, a car, aTV), their aspirations increase for goods which were initiallymuch less likely to be viewed as part of the good life. In eachsegment of the life cycle, travel abroad, a swimming pool, and avacation home are increasingly named as part of the good life,\\nFig. 4.

The propor-\\ntion that ever actually has any of these items, however, is typically/H1102110%. This finding suggests that new material aspirations arise\\nas previous ones are satisfied, and, to judge from the meannumber of goods desired, to about the same extent.\\nThis inference of complete adaptation in the economic do-\\nmain is further supported if we divide the cohort by level ofeducation. In each segment of the life cycle, the increase in thenumber of goods owned is greater for those with more education,as one would expect based on their greater income growth, butthe increase in number of goods desired is also greater for thosewith more education. Moreover, for both educational groups,the increase in desires is of the same order of magnitude as theincrease in the number of goods owned. Thus, material aspira-tions are increasing commensurately with material possessions,and the greater the increase in possessions, the greater theincrease in desires. It is this differential change in aspirationscorresponding to the differential change in income that explainsthe constancy of happiness over the life cycle for each educa-tional group (33). The point-of-time happiness differential is alsoexplained by aspirations (33). At the start of the adult life cycle,material aspirations differ very little between the two educationgroups; hence, the better-educated come closer to fulfilling theiraspirations, and are happier. Subsequently, aspirations rise morefor the better-educated, but at any point in time the dispersionin aspirations relative to that in income continues to be the same,and the happiness differential by education persists.\\nThe responses cited so far are for specific goods. Is there\\nevidence suggesting that income aspirations in general rise inproportion to income? The answer is yes. Consider the answersfrom a different survey that asks people how much income isneeded by a family of four to get along. Over a 36-year period,‘‘get along ’’income increases, on average, to the same degree as\\nactual income (36).\\nTo turn to the family domain, the desire for a happy marriage\\nis a common one. At every point in the life cycle, three-quartersor more of respondents say that a happy marriage is part of thegood life. The proportion that actually has a happy marriage,however, is considerably less, averaging a little over one-half.\\nIf adaptation were complete, then one would expect that\\npersons who are not in a happy marriage would eventually giveup their desires for such a marriage. In fact, aspirations for ahappy marriage persist among more than half of those respon-dents who do not actually have one (Table 4). Among never-married persons ages 45 and over, that is, persons who have beensingle their entire lives, /H110224 in 10 cite a happy marriage as part\\nof the good life as far as they personally are concerned (Table4). Among widows and divorcees 45 years and older, for whomthe prospect of remarriage is low, more than half continue toaspire to a happy marriage (Table 4). Thus, for around half ofunmarried persons who have little prospect of marrying, aspi-rations have not adjusted to their actual marital circumstances.In contrast to the economic domain, hedonic adaptation seemsto be occurring only to a limited extent with regard to marriage\\ncircumstances. The substantial persistence of the desire for ahappy marriage among those widowed, divorced, and never-married explains, I believe, why these groups are less happy, onaverage, than married persons, among whom aspirations for ahappy marriage are more nearly fulfilled.\\nIn addition to marriage aspirations, the ‘‘good life ’’survey\\nelicits information on aspirations regarding number and ‘‘qual-\\nity’’of children, quality being indicated by desires for a college\\neducation for one ’s children. Although income growth over the\\nlife cycle is accompanied by persistent growth in aspirations forbig ticket consumer goods, income growth is not associated withgrowth in desires for either the number or quality of children.\\nI have no data on health aspirations, but I suspect that\\naspirations for ‘‘good health ’’persist even as actual health\\ndeteriorates, and adaptation to worsening health is consequentlyless than complete. I think there is evidence of less than completeadaptation in regard to other life circumstances as well, such asfriendship, loss of a job, and retirement (29, 37 –41).\\nExplaining Happiness\\nWe can now begin to see the outlines of a better theory of how\\nlife events affect happiness. Let us start with the economist ’s\\nnotion that the typical individual has a utility or happinessfunction such that well-being depends on a variety of pecuniaryand nonpecuniary conditions, or domains. The typical person istaken to have certain goals or aspirations and a current state ofattainment in each domain. The overall happiness of the indi-vidual depends on the shortfall between aspirations and attain-ments in each domain, and the relative importance of eachdomain in the individual ’s utility function.\\nEconomic theory typically assumes that well-being depends\\nonly on attainments. However, there are two strands of theory,habit formation and interdependent preferences, that recognizethe effect on well-being of aspirations. Habit formation stressesthat the utility one derives from a given set of goods is affectedby comparisons with one ’s past experience (42, 43). Interdepen-\\ndent preferences points out that the utility created by one ’s\\nhaving a given amount of a good depends partly on the amountof that good that others have (44, 45). The counterpart inpsychology of the economists ’concept of habit formation is\\nhedonic adaptation (15, 46, 47), and the counterpart of inter-dependent preferences is social comparison (48). I use thepsychologists ’terms in what follows, because these are more\\ncommon in the literature on subjective well-being.\\nThe central point of the present theory of happiness is that\\nneither hedonic adaptation nor social comparison operateequally across all domains or constituents of domains. Hedonicadaptation, as we have seen, is less complete with regard tofamily circumstances and health than in the material goodsdomain. I suggest that social comparison is also less in family lifeand health than in the material goods domain, because thesecircumstances are less accessible to public scrutiny than materialpossessions.\\nMoreover, hedonic adaptation and social comparison may not\\noperate equally with regard to all constituents of a given domain.With regard to the material goods domain, Scitovsky (49) hasargued that cultural goods, such as music, literature, and art, areless subject to hedonic adaptation than ‘‘comfort ’’goods, like\\nhomes and cars. Similarly, the distinction drawn between posi-tional and nonpositional goods by Frank (50), Hirsch (51), andNg (52) is an example of a classification of goods based onwhether their utility is affected by social comparison.\\nEach individual has only a given amount of time to allocate\\namong different domains and their constituents. Clearly, thehappiness of an individual can be maximized by allocating his orher time to those domains and constituents of domains in whichhedonic adaptation and social comparison are less important.\\nTable 4.

My answer is no; peopleallocate a disproportionate amount of time to the pursuit ofpecuniary rather than nonpecuniary objectives, as well as to\\n‘‘comfort ’’and positional goods, and shortchange goals that will\\nhave a more lasting effect on well-being (see also ref. 53). Thismisallocation occurs because, in making decisions about how touse their time, individuals take their aspirations as fixed at theirpresent levels, and fail to recognize that aspirations may changebecause of hedonic adaptation and social comparison. In par-ticular, people make decisions assuming that more income,comfort, and positional goods will make them happier, failing torecognize that hedonic adaptation and social comparison willcome into play, raise their aspirations to about the same extentas their actual gains, and leave them feeling no happier thanbefore. As a result, most individuals spend a disproportionateamount of their lives working to make money, and sacrificefamily life and health, domains in which aspirations remain fairlyconstant as actual circumstances change, and where the attain-ment of one ’s goals has a more lasting impact on happiness.\\nHence, a reallocation of time in favor of family life and healthwould, on average, increase individual happiness.\\nOne may ask whether social learning occurs, don ’t people\\neventually realize how their material aspirations escalate witheconomic achievement, and become aware of the self-defeatingnature of the pursuit of pecuniary goals? The answer is no,because the change in material aspirations itself works againstsocial learning. When asked how happy they were 5 years ago,people, on average, systematically understate their well-being atthat time, because they evaluate their past situation in terms, notof the lower material aspirations they actually had at that time,but on the basis of the new higher level of aspirations they havenow acquired (33, 55). As a result, they tend to think they arebetter off than they were in the past, rather than realizing thatthere has been no net improvement.\\nI have been focusing on the effect of life circumstances on\\nhappiness, because these are conditions through which happinessmay be especially increased by individual and social action. Lifecircumstances other than those discussed here, such as friend-ships, work, and employment status, affect happiness too, butincome, family, and health conditions are typically cited most\\noften by people as sources of happiness (56). Personality andgenetic factors also affect happiness, of course. The interplaybetween life events and personality in shaping happiness at theindividual level is an important subject for research (see ref. 54,chapter 9). So too are the psychological, social, biological, andevolutionary mechanisms underlying the relationships reportedhere, including the question of why the adjustment of aspirationsto actual circumstances differs by domain (see ref. 15, p. 314).\\nEconomic policy proposals to improve well-being are typically\\ndirected toward altering the socioeconomic environment, butnot to changing individual preferences. Viewed in terms of thepresent analysis policies to improve health or facilitate more time\\nwith one ’s family are consistent with greater happiness. But the\\npresent analysis implies that preferences too are an appropriatepolicy concern. The reason preferences are excluded from policyconsideration by mainstream economics is because each indi-vidual is assumed to be the best judge of his or her own interests.But if individuals are making decisions in ignorance of the effectthat hedonic adaptation and social comparison will have on theiraspirations, this assumption no longer holds. Once it is recog-nized that individuals are unaware of some of the forces shapingtheir choices, it can no longer be argued that they will success-fully maximize their well-being. It is, perhaps, time to recognizethat serious attention is needed to devising measures that maycontribute to more informed preferences (see refs. 49 and 57).\\nMuch of the research on subjective well-being in the last two decades has\\nbeen by psychologists, and I have benefited greatly from their work,especially that of Paul T. Costa, Ed Diener, Robert R. McCrae, DavidG. Myers, and the contributors to the path-breaking volume on well-being assembled by Daniel Kahneman, Ed Diener, and Norbert Schwarz.In economics I am indebted particularly to the research of Robert H.Frank, Andrew J. Oswald, Tibor Scitovsky, and Bernard M. S. van Praag.Without the invaluable data collections of James A. Davis, Tom W.Smith, and Ruut Veenhoven, the present research would not have beenpossible.

Strack, M Argyle, & N. Schwarz (eds ) \\'Subjective wellbeing, an interdisciplinary \\nperspective\\', Pergamon Press, 1991, London, pp 7-26  \\n \\n \\n1.     INTRODUCTION\\n \\nHappiness is a longstanding theme in West ern thought. It came under scrutiny in the \\nfollowing three periods: (1) Antique Greek philosophy; (2) Post-Enlightenment West-\\nEuropean moral philosophy, Utilitarianism in pa rticular; and (3) Current Quality-of-Life \\nresearch in the rich welfare states. Printed reflections on all this contemplation now fill a \\nhundred meters of bookshelves. \\nThis paper takes stock of the progress made on seven classical topics. Are we now any wiser? Or is Dodge (1930) right  in his contention that “the theory of the happy life has \\nremained on about the same level that the ancient Greeks left it”? This inventory will differ \\nfrom the usual review articles. The focus will not be on current technica l research issues, but \\nrather on the broader questions that prompted the enquiry. Furthermore, the aim is not only \\nto enumerate advances in understanding, but also to mark the blind spots. \\n \\nThe following issues will be considered:  \\n1. What is happiness? \\n2. Can happiness be measured? \\n3. Is unhappiness the rule? \\n4. How do people assess their happiness? \\n5. What conditions favour happiness? \\n6. Can happiness be promoted? \\n7. Should happiness be promoted? \\n \\nThese scientific issues do not emerge in a so cial vacuum, but are rooted in broader moral \\nand political debates. Questions 1 and 7 are part of an ongoing ethi cal discussion about \\nvalue priorities. Which values should guide us? How should we rank values such as “wisdom”, “equality”, “justice”, “freedom” a nd “happiness”? Together with question 5,  \\nthese issues also figure in the related poli tical debates about soci o-economic priorities. \\nShould the emphasis be on national economic grow th or on individual wellbeing? Who are \\nthe deprived in our society? How can their suffering best be reduced? \\nQuestions 2 to 6 further link up with the discussion about the possibilities and dangers of \\nsocio-political technocracy.

Will the political system ever be able to put such \\npolicies into practice? If so, will not the remedy be worse than the disease, and bring about a “Brave New World”? Questions 3 to 6 relate to the broad argument between pessimists and \\noptimists. They are all issues in the discussion as  to whether current soci ety is rotten or not, \\nand whether social development holds any prom ise for a better one. Questions 4 and 5 are \\nrelevant in the debate on human nature. Is happi ness the result of rationa l consideration or of \\nfollowing blind instincts? Has human happiness anything to do with th e real good or can we \\nbe happy in any condition? Finally, question 3 is an issue in the ongoing discussion about \\nthe legitimacy of the political order. If most people feel ha ppy under the current regime, why \\nchange it? For that reason, conservatives tend to claim that we are happy, while revolutionaries try to prove we are not. \\n \\n \\n2.       WHAT IS HAPPINESS? \\n \\nThe history of happiness research is the hi story of confusion. The term has carried many \\ndifferent meanings and this has hindered productive thinking e normously. Nowadays, \\nthe discussion has largely escaped from this dead lock. In fact, the greatest advance achieved \\nis at the conceptual level. \\n       Part of the problem is not specific to the subject matter but results from the variety \\nof meanings the term happiness has in common language. Because of the lack of conceptual discipline, that confusion of tongues has been continued into the scientific debate. An \\nadditional problem is that the seemingly technical discussion about the proper use of words \\nin fact covers up an ideologi cal debate about value priorities. In many arguments the term \\n“happiness” is used as a synonym for “the good”. “Defining” happiness is then propagating \\nan ideology. Therefore, a consensus on the use of the word has never emerged. \\n \\nRecent conceptual differentiation \\nIn the 1950s the use of concepts such as “w elfare”, “adjustment” and “mental health” had \\nmuch in common with the trad itional confusion a bout “happiness”. Yet in the last few \\ndecades social scientists have largely escaped from these deadlocks and have thereby \\nallowed a breakthrough in the con ceptualization of happiness. It is now generally agreed that \\nthere are many varieties of goodness, which do not necessarily concur. A classification of \\ncurrent concepts is presented by Scheme 2.1. \\nThe reader should bear in mind that the enumeration is illustrative rather than exhaustive.\\nFurthermore, most of the terms mentioned are used with other meanings as well and could\\ntherefore be classified  differently. Elsewhere I have elaborated this classification in more\\ndetail (Veenhoven, 1980).   \\n \\nFocus on life satisfaction \\nThis paper will focus on happiness in the sens e of life satisfaction. We cannot answer the \\nseven questions for all concepts. Therefore, a choice is required. I choose the overall self-appraisal of life for four reasons: (1) This co ncept can be fairly precisely defined (see \\nbelow); (2) the phenomenon thus defined can be m easured fairly well (to be demonstrated in \\nthe next paragraph); (3) there are empirical data on this matter which allow answers to the \\nquestions raised; (4) focusing on an “objective” conception of happiness would involve a \\npriori answers to several of  the questions under discussion. \\nRuut Veenhoven 2 Questions on happinessLife satisfaction is conceived as the degree to which an individual  judges the overall quality \\nof his life-as-a-whole favourably . In other words: how well he  likes the life he leads. The \\nterm “happiness” will be used as a synonym. \\nNext to this “overall” evaluation, this paper will refer to two aspect appraisals of life-as-a-\\nwhole an affective aspect (hedonic level) and a cognitive aspect (contentment). Hedonic \\nlevel is the degree to which th e various affects a pe rson experiences are pleasant; in other \\nwords: how well he usually f eels. Contentment is the degree to which an individual \\nperceives his aspirations to have  been met. In other words: to what extent one perceives \\noneself to have got what one wants in life. These distinctions will prove fruitful in \\nanswering the questions asked here. The co ncepts are described in more detail in \\nVeenhoven, 1984a, chapter 2. \\n \\n \\n3.       CAN HAPPINESS BE MEASURED? \\n \\nDuring the last century frequent discussions have taken place as to whether happiness can be \\nmeasured. These debates were part of the di scussion about the utilit arian moral philosophy, \\nwhich required some kind of hedonic bookkeeping in order to assess the happiness revenues \\nof alternative courses of action. A great deal of that discussion is  not relevant for this paper, \\nbecause it concerns conceptions  other than life-satisfaction. \\nWhen happiness polls began to be used during the last few decades, the discussion focused on whether subjective apprecia tion of life can be assessed validly. The following issues \\nfigured in that discussion: (1) Can happiness be measured “objectively” or only \\n“subjectively” by questioning? (2 ) If questioning is the only way, do interviews tap an \\nexisting state of mind or do they  merely invite a guess? (3) If  people do indeed have an idea \\nabout their enjoyment of life, do their responses  to questions reflect that idea adequately? \\nThese questions have instigated a great deal of empirical research and can now be fairly well \\nanswered. \\n“Measurement” was long understood as “objective”,  “external” assessment, analogous to the \\nmeasurement of blood-pressure by a doctor. It is  now clear that life satisfaction cannot be \\nmeasured that way. Steady physiological co ncomitants have not been discovered and \\nmodern insights into the complexity of psycho- physiological interactions do not suggest that \\nthey ever will be. Neither have any overt behaviours been found to be linked reliably to \\ninner enjoyment of life. Like all attitudes, happiness is reflected only partly in social \\nbehaviour. Though an “active”, “outgoing” and “f riendly” appearance is more frequent \\namong the happy, it is observed among unhappy persons as well. Even unconscious body \\nlanguage has been found to be on ly weakly related to the inne r appreciation of  life (Noelle--\\nNeumann, 1977, p. 244). Consequently, ratings of someone’s happiness by his peers or \\nteachers are only weakly related to self-repor ts (research reviewed in Veenhoven, 1984a, pp. \\n83—84). The case of suicide was long considered to be an exception. This kind of behaviour \\nwas thought to indicate extreme unhappiness. However, the abundant  research in that field \\nhas made it clear that dissatisfaction with life is at best one of the motives and that there is a \\ngreat cultural and personal va riation in one’s capac ity to cope with unhappiness, other than \\nby committing suicide.  \\n \\n \\nRuut Veenhoven 3 Questions on happiness3.1       Assessment by observation3.2        Assessment by questioning \\nInference from overt behaviour being impossible,  we must make do with questioning: either \\ndirect or indirect and in a personal interview or by an anonymous questionnaire. Great \\ndoubts have been expressed about the validity of such self-reports of happiness. However, \\nempirical checks of these suspic ions have not revealed great distortions (see Chapter 3 for a \\ndifferent perspective) \\nOne of the doubts raised is that most people would have no opinion at all about their life \\nsatisfaction. Answers to questions on that subj ect would reflect other things: in particular \\nprevailing norms of self-presentation. Howe ver, people appear to be quite aware of their \\nenjoyment of life. Eight out of ten Americans think of it once a week or more often (Shaver \\nand Freedman, 1975, p. 70). Consequently, responses on happiness items tend to be prompt, \\nthe non-response is low and temporal stability high. Stereotypical respon ses are not the rule \\n(evidence reviewed in Veenhoven, 1984, pp. 40 - 42). \\nIt is often claimed that people present themselves happier than - deep in their heart - they \\nknow they are. Both ego-defensive and social desirability effects would be involved. This \\ndistortion should give its elf away in the often observed overrepresentation of “very happy” \\npeople, in the fact that most  people perceived themselves ha ppier than average and in the \\nfinding that psychosomatic complaints are not uncommon among persons who characterize \\nthemselves as being happy. Yet these facts pr ovide no proof. As we will see in the next \\nparagraph, it is quite comprehensible that a positive appreciation of life prevails. There are \\nalso reasons why most people co uld honestly imagine themselves happier than average, and \\nreasons why the presence of psychosomatic complaints does not exclude a positive appreci-\\nation of life. The proof of the pudding is a dem onstration of distortion its elf. Several clinical \\nstudies have tried to do so, but failed to find evidence for a general overstatement of \\nhappiness (research reviewed in Veenhoven, 1984a, pp. 44-51). \\nAlthough there is no proof of systematic desirability distortion, there is evidence that \\nresponses to questions on happiness are liable to  various situational influences, such as the \\nsite of the interview, the inte rviewer, the weather, one’s mood, etc. (see Chapter 3). These \\ndifferences can be considered as essentially ra ndom error, because they  tend to disappear in \\nrepeated observations of th e usual one-time-one-item measurement. More systematic \\nmeasurement error is involved as well. Respons es are influenced by the precise wording of \\nquestions, answer formats, seque nce of questions and context of  the interview (see Strack \\nand Martin, 1987). \\nAndrews and Whithey (1976, p. 216) estimated that error produces about half the variance in happiness reports. Several reasons for this vulnerability seem to be involved. Firstly, \\nsome people may not have a definite opi nion in mind and engage in an instant \\n(re)assessment which is then influenced by situational characteristics (see Chapter 3). \\nSecondly, those who do have a definite opinion will mostly hold a rather global idea of how \\nhappy they are and will not think in terms of a ten points scale. Hence, their precise score \\nmay vary. Thirdly, the process of retrieva l involves some uncertainty as well. \\n \\n \\n4.        IS UNHAPPINESS THE RULE?\\n \\nSocial critics of all times have bemoaned the mi series of life. Most people are believed to be \\nbasically dissatisfied and real enjoyment of life is to be projected in past paradise or future \\nutopia. Such claims have always been denoun ced by optimists but the discussion has always \\nRuut Veenhoven 4 Questions on happinessbeen inconclusive. During the last few decades many surveys have been carried out (see \\nChapter 13), some drawing on world samples: so is it now finally possible to draw a \\nconclusion? \\nThe first representative surveys were carried out in Western countries and showed an uneven distribution of happy and unhappy citizens: the happy outweighing the unhappy by about 3 \\nto 1. This finding raised much doubt about the validity of survey questions (discussed \\nearlier). Later cross-national studies have reproduced this pattern in less affluent non-\\nWestern countries as well, but not in the Thir d World nations where a large proportion of the \\npopulation lives at subsistence levels (see Scheme 2.2 (Veenhoven 1984a)). This latter \\nfinding took away many of the validity doubts: a universal tendency to claim happiness in \\nthe face of misery is not involved. \\nVarious social critics have discounted such findings as sullen adjustment. Rather than really enjoying their life, people would just give up hope for a better one and try to make the best \\nof it (e.g. Ipsen, 1978, p.49). Variou s defensive strategies would be used for that purpose: \\nsimple denial of one’s misery; downward comparison (Wills, 1981) and a tendency to see \\nthings rosier than they are (Ostroot a nd Snyder, 1982). This view is supported in \\nexperiments suggesting “depressive realism” (Alloy and Abramson, 1979). Two counter-arguments can be mentioned: \\n \\n(1) Such resignation must give itself away in a discrepancy between the “constructed” \\njudgment of life and “raw” affective experience : in my terms between “overall happiness” \\nand “hedonic level”. Hedonic level is less vulner able to cognitive adaptation, because it is a \\ndirect experience and is less open to defensive distortion, because it is less threatening to \\nadmit that one feels bad sometimes than to admit to being disappointed in life. Various \\nsurveys in Western nations have assessed both overall happiness and hedonic level and \\nfound these highly correlated (research reviewed in Veenhoven, 1984a pp. 106 - 113).¹ \\nStudies focusing on daily variati ons in mood have also found th at pleasant affect dominates \\nunpleasant affect (e.g., Bless and Schwarz, 1984 fo r a meta-analysis of eighteen studies). \\n    (2) Elaborate comparisons between actual living conditions and subjective appreciation of \\nlife have shown that the pattern of high life sa tisfaction in the face of relatively bad living \\nconditions is the exception ra ther than the rule (Glatzer and Zapf, 1984, pp. 282—397). \\n \\nTogether these findings suggest that people tend  to enjoy their lives once conditions are not \\ntoo bad. From an adaptive biological point of vi ew this does not seem strange. Nature is \\nunlikely to have burdened us with characteri stic unhappiness, because evolution is unlikely \\nto result in a species that does not fit its characteristic environment subjectively. Like \\n“health”, happiness would seem to be a normal condition. \\nOne argument for this latter theory is that happiness has a certain survival value. As we will \\nsee in more detail later, en joyment of life fosters “activity”,  strengthens “social bonds” and \\npreserves “health”. \\nThere is a little evidence for a biological substrate of this capacity for happiness. In the \\nhuman brain more areas seem to produce positive experiences than negative ones (25  per \\ncent to 5 per cent, according to Fordyce, 1975, p. 191). \\nThe prevalence of satisfaction with life-as-a-whole does not wash away the multitude of \\nsuffering and complaints. As noted in the foregoing paragraphs, even the happy are not without complaints. The German Welfare Surv ey, conducted in 1978, found that half of the \\n“highly satisfied” report frequent worries (Glatzer and Zapf, 1984, p. 180). \\nRuut Veenhoven 5 Questions on happinessIf not due to response distortion, what else ca n explain these anomalies? One first thing to \\nnote is that happiness and complaining do not exclude each other logically. One can be \\nfairly satisfied with life as a w hole, but still be awar e of serious deficits. In fact, both stem \\nfrom a reflection on life. Secondly, bad feeli ngs and perception of problems may to some \\nextent contribute to overall ha ppiness. Only through realisti c acknowledgement of pains can \\npeople cope effectively with the problems of life and thereby maintain a positive overall \\nbalance. \\n \\n \\n5.        HOW DO PEOPLE ASSESS THEIR HAPPINESS? \\n \\nWhat goes on in people when they evaluate their life? This inner manufacturing of \\nhappiness is a subject full of controversies: whether happiness is th e product of “thinking” \\nor of “emotion”; whether it is a “state” or a “trait”; whether it results entirely from \\n“comparison” or results from th e gratification of “needs”, etc.  The issue was a major theme \\nin antique philosophy about happiness and enjoys a renewed interest nowadays. It is not just \\ncuriosity about the insi de of the black box that draws one’s  attention, but rather the far-\\nreaching consequences of the different points of view. If happiness were indeed to result \\nentirely from comparison, it is  likely to be essent ially relative and he nce insensitive to \\nameliorations of the (objective) quality of life. A better society will not make happier \\npeople. If happiness is a fixed “disposition”, efforts to improve living conditions will not \\ncontribute to greater enjoyment either. Howeve r, if happiness draws on “need satisfaction”, \\nthere is a point in trying to identify basic hum an urges and to facilitate their fulfillment. If \\npersonal cognitive “constructs” are involved, we might sometimes relieve suffering by \\nchanges in thinking. \\nThe discussion has yielded many facts and a lot of theories, which are difficult to oversee. A \\nsimple partition may help to sketch the field. Most questions and speculations about the inner fabrication of happiness concern mental processes. Yet it is widely acknowledged that \\na physical substrate is involve d as well. Likewise, most of  the discussion focuses on the \\nprocesses that produce variable states, while there is no doubt th at processes of stabilization \\ninto traits are involved as well. Together these two distinctions produce the four cell scheme \\nin Scheme 2.3. It allows an ordering of issues, provides a vi ew on current emphasis and may \\nto some extent correspond with  the realities involved. \\nTraditionally, the processes in cell 1 of the scheme have received the most attention, in \\nparticular the cognitive proce sses of comparison and making ove rall judgments. The growth \\nof cognitive psychology in the last few decades has triggered a great deal of new ideas on \\nthese matters. Theories on (social) comparison ha ve been refined and new perspectives have \\nbeen opened on how people may put things together. Elsewhere I have reviewed current \\nviews (Veenhoven, 1989). The mental mechanisms that underlie the emergence of (raw) \\npleasant affect are still largely a mystery. \\nLess progress has been made in answering the questions in cell 2. The classical trait-state \\ndiscussion still drags on: nowadays mostly presented as the bottom-up/top-down controversy. At the empirical level remarkable demonstrations have been provided for both \\nviews, yet understanding has a dvanced little, attention being focused too much on either/or \\nanswers. \\n \\n \\nRuut Veenhoven 6 Questions on happinessConsideration of the conditions in which a ppraisals of life “fr eeze” and “unfreeze” would \\nseem to be more productive. It could draw  on a wide body of know ledge about attitude \\nformation and personality. \\nThe physiology of happiness depicted in cell 3 is still largely terra incognita. In the 1960s \\nthe discovery of pleasure centers in the brain seemed to promise a breakthrough (Olds, 1956). That promise has become somewhat bleak by now. There ar e more than one pleasure \\ncenters and their links with thinking and experience remain unclear. Pharmacological \\nresearch has not yet resulted in great progress either. Various mood elevating chemicals \\nhave been identified but their working is only dimly understood. \\n       The issues in cell 4 are genera lly acknowledged as highly releva nt but empirica l research \\non the matter is difficult and expensive. The 1930s witnessed some minor attempts to \\ndemonstrate temperamental differences in happiness proneness. In the last decade more \\nserious research has been launched in the rela ted field of depression in the tradition of \\n“biological psychiatry”. With the exception of “manic depression”, no clear biological basis \\nhas been identified as yet. \\n \\n \\n6.       WHAT CONDITIONS FAVOUR HAPPINESS? \\n \\nThis question lies at the heart of  various moral and political deba tes. What lifestyle is most \\nsatisfying in the long run? What society allo ws the greatest happiness for the greatest \\nnumber? Scientific answers c ould provide the consensus ideo logists fail to achieve and \\ncould legitimize social reform. Although quite  relevant, the study of conditions for \\nhappiness is still in its infancy. As yet at  least one thousand em pirical studies have \\nconsidered the differences between happy and unhappy persons. Elsewhere I have reported \\na synthesis part of that research (Veenhoven, 1984a and 1 984b). This analysis concerned \\n245 studies in 32 countries. \\nAt the risk of simplifying too much, one could characterize the results as follows: happy \\npersons are more likely to be found in th e economically prospero us countries, where \\nfreedom and democracy are held in respect a nd the political scene is stable. The happy are \\nmore likely to be found in majority groups than  among minorities and more often at the top \\nof the social ladder than at the bottom. Th ey are typically married and get on well with \\nfamilies and friends. In respect of their personal characteristics, the happy appear relatively \\nhealthy, both physically and me ntally. They are active and op enminded. They feel they are \\nin control of their lives. Their aspirations c oncern social and moral matters rather than \\nmoney making. In matter of politics the happy tend to be at the conservative side of the middle. \\nDo these findings allow a conclusion in the above mentioned debates? Unfortunately they do \\nnot, at least not yet. The following limitations stand in the way: The variables related to \\nhappiness as yet are largely easy to measure. Se veral equally relevant variables are absent: \\nprobably because of methodical problems. One such white spot is the “cultural climate” in \\nsociety: the “meaning” the prevailing belief system provides; the “expression” it allows; \\nthe amount of “conformism” it requires, etc. At the individual level we miss data on various  \\nantecedents of happiness such as: “style of upbringing” and “stress in early youth”.  \\n Most of the studies are simple, correlational ones. The statistical relations they yield can be \\nartifactual. In particular s purious distortion can be involve d: e.g. when happiness appears \\nRuut Veenhoven 7 Questions on happinessrelated to income, that may be due to the fact  that the happy tend to  be better educated, \\nrather than from a genuine effect of income. Only some of the studies have checked such \\ndistortions systematically. \\n  \\nUncertainty about causal effects \\nCorrelates of happiness are generally considered  as “causes” of happiness. Yet statistical \\nlinks can result from reversed effects as well. If happiness appears related to income, this \\ncannot just be interpreted as si gnifying that a good income cont ributes to the appreciation of \\nlife. Happiness could affect income level as we ll: e.g. because enjoyment of life stimulates \\n“energy” and “doing”. Unraveling causes and eff ects is difficult and often not feasible. It \\nrequires longitudinal and experimental st udies, which are rare in this field. \\n    Investigators typically aim at identifying “the” conditions for happiness. However, the assumption of general “laws” is not very fruitful. By bitter e xperience we have learned that \\nmany of the regularities we obser ve are highly conditi onal. The field of happiness research \\nis no exception. The best way to identify such  contextual variations is to perform large \\nlongitudinal and cross-national surveys. A me ta-analysis of existing data is a cheap \\nalternative. \\n \\n \\n7.        CAN HAPPINESS BE RAISED? \\n \\nMuch of all this considerati on of happiness is prompted by the hope of finding ways to a \\nmore satisfying life. Traditionally, moral philosophers have sought guidelines at the \\nindividual level. Which life goals are most gr atifying in the long run? What lifestyle most \\nsatisfying? What character tendencies harm happiness, what traits should be cultivated? \\nCurrently the emphasis is on th e collective level. What shoul d governments do to allow their \\ncitizens the best life? What socio-economic and educational policies have the highest \\nhappiness revenues? \\nYet many people doubt whether happiness levels can be changed at all.This doubt is rooted \\nin the belief that happiness is too variable and elusive to allo w manipulation, and in theories \\nabout happiness which imply that it cannot be changed anyway. \\n \\n7.1      Can happiness be influenced at all? \\nTwo theories of happiness imply that enduring change is not possible.Attempts to improve \\nhappiness would be in vain. \\n \\nZero sum? \\nOne theory is that happine ss is cyclical: happy  periods are always followed by unhappy \\nperiods. In the longer run thes e swings are believed to ne utralize each other (zero sum). \\nHence, attempts to improve happiness may lengt hen or heighten a pos itive swing, but their \\neffect is invariably nullified by a depression soon  after. This classic idea has been reinvented \\nby Unger (1970) and figures currently in a psycho-physical form in Solomon’s (1980) \\nOpponent-Process Theory. This theory does not apply to happiness as defined here.\\n   This theory does not apply to happiness as defined here. Observations of mood and life satisfaction across  time do not show any cyclical pattern (e.g. Fordyce, 1972, pp. 151-153).\\n        Neither has the zero sum prediction been proved true. As we have seen previously, most \\npeople  feel posi tive about their life ra ther than neutral. \\nRuut Veenhoven 8 Questions on happiness \\n \\nFixed trait? \\nThe other theory is that happiness does not even  vary in the short run, but remains the same \\nthroughout life. This inertia ha s been attributed to neurological make up as well as to \\nprocesses of attitudinal stab ilization. The latter view has already been discussed. \\nAs we have seen there, appreciation of life indeed tends to change little through adulthood. \\nYet high stability observed in most cases does not imply inchangeability at all times. Firstly, \\nwe must keep in mind that the investigatio ns concerned elderly populations. Happiness is \\nprobably less stable in adolescence and young adulthood, when living conditions are more \\nvariable and opinions about life less crystallized. Secondly, vari ous studies have shown that \\nhappiness is not left unaffected by major life changes. Thirdly, the investigations figure in a \\nsocio-historical context characterized by stabil ity. Things might have been different if a \\nThird World War had take n place in the sixties. \\nRather than saying happiness “is” fixed, we should say that it “tends to get” fixed. In adolescence and young adulthood the attitude  towa rds life is likely to be most open to \\nchange. In later phases of life it is likely to ch ange only under the pressure of rather drastic \\nlife changes, especially if  these involve a wider re orientation of the self. \\n \\n                                         \\n7.2       Can happiness be learned? \\nSince antiquity there have b een books on how to become happi er. Since the1970s happiness-\\ntrainings have appeared on the scene (inter alia , Fordyce, 1977). Both presume that \\nhappiness can be learned. A commo n objection to these practices is that the rather uniform \\nrecipes involved do not work, mostly because people are too different. A second objection is \\nthat good advice seldom works, people being too inflexible, the unhappy in particular. \\n    Antique moral philosophers mostly recommend a sober and contemplative lifestyle,  a positive philosophy of life and a disciplined character. Nowadays, that idea is still held in \\nrespect in that various “learned” qualities are believed to predispose one for a happy life. \\nHowever, current opinion holds that there is  no one “ideal” model. Rather, present-day \\npedagogues, educationalists and therapists emphas ize that developmental goals must be tai-\\nlored to personal preferences and capacities and situational oppor tunities. Individual trainings \\nare better suited to that purpose than general books of good advice. \\nIrrespective of these possibilities for individual treatment, there are many learnable qualities \\nthat generally predispose one to lead a happy life. “Ignorance”, “hate” and “lack of control” \\nwill at least reduce chances for gratifying expe riences in most cases. Not only does human \\nnature set universal developmental demands (e.g. the innate need for contact requiring \\nsociability), but also general existential conditions (we must all live with others and \\ntherefore need capacities to establish stable relations). Empirical identification of such \\ngenerally useful qualities is pos sible. As we have seen pr eviously, empirical happiness \\nresearch has considered various personality and lifestyle variables. Characteristics found \\nover-represented among the happy are: “identity integrity”, “ego-strength”, “mental maturity”, “inner control”, “social ability”, “activity” and “perceptual openness”. Not sur-\\nprisingly, these characteristics are typical conc omitants of mental heal th, and goals in many \\npsychotherapies. \\n \\n \\nRuut Veenhoven 9 Questions on happiness \\n \\nAntique prescriptions are confir med in that material aspirations appear under-represented \\namong the happy. However, the classic notion that sober and planned living is most \\nrewarding is not confirmed, nor  the idea that intelligence and psychological differentiation \\nfavour happiness. \\nThe classical prescriptions for greater happiness by personal improvement presumed \\n“rational” people, who are both willing and able to change themselves. Their critics have argued that stupidity and inflexibility are rath er the rule. Moreover, personality building is \\nlargely accomplished in early youth within the uncontrollable re alm of the family, leaving \\nonly marginal room for psychological engineering by formal institutions such as schools and \\nmental health care. Several facts can be introduced to support these arguments: e.g. the \\nearlier mentioned finding that happiness tends  to be remarkably stable and the common \\nlamentation that psychotherapy does not work. \\nThere is certainly a great deal of truth in these objections, but the point should not be exaggerated. Firstly, research has shown that special educational programs can foster the \\ndevelopment of desirable characteristics su ch as self-esteem, autonomy and control. \\nSecondly, psychotherapy has proved to work for at least some kinds of  problems. Thirdly, \\nthe early socialization in families is not entire ly “uncontrolled”, but figures in the context of \\na belief system that is not enti rely insensitive to influence. \\nThe proof of the pudding is of course experimental demonstration. During the last decade a few small-scale experiments have been repo rted. Firstly, several experiments checked \\nwhether happiness can be raised by the teachin g of specific qualities, such as focusing on \\n“satisfying activities” (Reich and Zautra, 1981), “reviewing one’s  life” (Fergusson, 1980), \\n“assertiveness” (Johnson, 1981) and “cognitive self-control” (Jeziarsky, 1982). The \\nobserved effects on happiness are generally sma ll or nonexistent. Secondly, some studies on \\nthe effectiveness of general psychotherapy programs have considered happiness as one of \\nthe outcome variables (e.g. Morgan, 1978; O’ Dowd, 1978; Naskeff, 1980). Slight positive \\neffects appear. Lastly, two comprehensive attempts to influence happiness by cognitive \\nretraining have been reported (Lichter et al., 1980; Fordyce, 1977). These “happiness \\ncourses” required subjects to practice self-suggestion of happine ss, to lower th eir aspirations \\nand to engage more in behaviour already prov en to be beneficial, such as socializing. \\nExperimental groups showed improvement in happiness over control groups. None of these \\nfollow ups cover more than a few months. Henc e, it is not yet clear whether happiness can \\nbe boosted permanently in this way. \\n \\n \\n7.3        Can social improvements raise happiness? \\nThe expectation that planned social improvements can raise human happiness is one of the \\nideological foundations of curre nt welfare states. Yet this idea is subject to much doubt. \\nSociologists have objected that planned improvement of society is illusional, the political \\nprocess being irrational (VanDoorn and Sc huyt, 1978). Psychologist s have added that \\npossible improvements do not materialize in  greater satisfaction. Firstly, social \\n“improvements” would be largely irrelevant, happiness drawing on “inner” sources rather than on “outer” ones. Secondly, relevant impr ovements would often be nullified by social \\ncomparison processes. Thirdly, the few possible gains would soon be washed away by the inevitable adjustment of standards. Below I will consider these claims in more detail. \\nRuut Veenhoven 10 Questions on happiness \\n \\nConditions irrelevant? \\nDown the ages mystics and ascetics have prea ched that happiness cannot be found in the \\noutside world, but depends entire ly on one’s “inner lif e”. Currently this view is echoed in \\ninterpretations of modern empirical research, in  particular the finding that happiness tends to \\nbe quite stable through time and that happine ss relates more strongly to psychological \\nvariables than to socio-economic ones (as discussed previously). \\nYet these results can be interpreted in a different way: as argued earlier, the apparent \\nstability of happiness does not im ply that it is entirely insensitiv e to weal and woe. Further, \\nlow correlations with some socio-economic vari ables do not mean that external conditions \\nare always irrelevant to happiness. As we have seen, bad economic conditions in most \\nAfrican an Asian countries have a devastating effect on happiness. Moreover, there are more \\n“outer” conditions than just “economic affluen ce” and “social position”: the political system \\nunder which one lives; macro-cultural traits such as current beliefs and modes of expression; \\ninterpersonal networks, etc. Th ese conditions do app ear important, the latter in particular. \\nHappiness depends heavily on ties with spouse, family and friends, in Western societies especially (research reviewed  in Veenhoven, 1984a, pp. 232 - 258). \\nApart from these empirical proofs to the contrary, the idea that outer conditions do not count \\nmust be rejected on other grounds as well: stab le attitudes towards lif e, once established, \\nmay be largely insensitive to living conditions , but while being established they clearly \\ndepend on them. Likewise, the effect on happiness of  “inner” sources such as wisdom and \\nvigour depends largely on their in teraction with “outer ” variables: they en able the individual \\nto cope more effectively with the problems of life. Again it is also unlikely that the human \\nspecies could have survived if its happi ness were unresponsive to the environment. \\n \\n \\nSocial comparison only? \\nAnother objection is that the appreciation of life would depend on the degree to which one considers oneself to be “better off” than other people. Then all -round improvement would \\nnot contribute to happiness: the distance to  reference persons would remain the same. \\nSeveral striking findings have b een interpreted as proof of this theory: e.g. the finding that \\nAmericans did not become much happier in the post-war decades in spite of doubling of \\nincome per head (Easterlin, 1974) and the obs ervation that seriously handicapped persons \\nmaintain a reasonable appreciation of life by comparing themselves to fellow sufferers \\n(Cameron, Van Harck, and Kostin, 1971). \\nThere is little doubt (though no convincing proof) that social comparisons are involved in \\nthe evaluation of life, but the available data al so make clear that their effect is not all \\nimportant. Firstly, Michalos (1985) has demonstrated that more standards of comparison are \\ninvolved than just social ones. In fact, compar isons to other persons appear to be not even \\nthe most important standard. Further, there is  evidence that they affect happiness only in \\nspecific conditions, e.g. when differences are regarded as unjustified (Glatzer and Zapf, \\n1984, p. 242). Secondly, we have seen earlier that the evalua tion of life also draws on \\naffective experience, which is largely de pendent on the gratification of basic bio-\\npsychological needs. These needs are essen tially non-relative. Consequently, serious \\ndeprivations at this level by “war”, “hunger”  and “social disorgan ization” do lower the \\nenjoyment of life drastically, notwithstanding the fact that everybody is hurt equally (evi-\\nRuut Veenhoven 11 Questions on happinessdence reviewed in Veenhoven, 1984, p. 400). \\nAs in the above case, one could ask how evolution could possibly have resulted in a way of \\nassessing life that fixes the individual on surp assing his fellow beings rather than focusing \\nthe attention on real weal and woe. \\n \\nInflation of aspirations? \\nAnother theory implying that happiness is re lative holds that we tend to get used to \\neverything. The effects of improvement or de terioration of living conditions on happiness \\nare hence short-lived. This theory was already advocated by the ancient Stoics. Currently, it \\nis phrased in terms of “psycho-phys ical adaptation leve l” theory and cogni tive “adjustment of \\naspirations” (Brickman and Campbell, 1971). As  in the above case, several remarkable \\nfindings have been presented in support of this theory: the fact that lottery winners appear to \\nbe hardly happier than average; and the obs ervation that quadriplegics tend to become \\nreconciled to their fate (Brickman et al., 1978, pp. 917-927). \\nYet again it is obvious that humans cannot adjust to any situation. Like the ‘‘absolute thresholds’’ in psycho-physics there are ‘‘minimu m levels’’ of need gratification. A few \\nanomalies apart, nobody can adjust to “s tarvation”, “loneline ss” and “injustice”. \\n \\nIn summary,  there is sense in trying to improve human happiness. Better living conditions and wiser, more sensible living can contribut e to more enjoyment in life. Though not all \\nrecipes work, many improvements ar e possible. The challenge for future research is not to \\nquestion the obvious any longer,  but to find out which impr ovements promise the greatest \\nyields. \\n \\n8.        SHOULD HAPPINESS BE PROMOTED? \\n \\nIf happiness levels can be raised, should th ey be raised? For the nineteenth-century \\nUtilitarian social philosophers this question did not exist. Their moral axiom was that happiness is the greatest good and that we shou ld promote it as much as possible (Greatest \\nHappiness Principle). Yet there have always be en philosophies that idealized suffering and \\nquestioned the desirability of life satisfaction. \\nFor a long time such issues were largely a matter of conviction, value priorities being beyond discussion. However, as we get a better vi ew of the reality cons equences of various \\nvalues, we become more aware of incompatib ilities with other valu es we endorse. As a \\nresult, we are now better able to predict which mix of values promises the most results. \\nCalculating ideological programs on the basis of empirically verified information about \\nreality consequences is in its infancy. Bay’s (1965)  study about the effect of and the \\npreconditions for various sorts of “freedom” provides an encouraging example. Let us \\nfollow that lead and consider the consequences of promoting happiness. Will happiness contribute to other values such as “peace”, “wisdom” and “morality” or will undesirable \\neffects prevail (egotism, apathy)? \\n \\n \\n8.1       Presumed consequences of happiness \\nTraditionally, anti-hedonists have argued that enjoyment of life has adversative \\nconsequences and thereby destr oys itself in the long run. Happiness is said to lead to \\n“apathetic easy going” and “irresponsible op timism”, thus ringing in economical and \\nRuut Veenhoven 12 Questions on happinesspolitical decline. Happiness is also expected to give way to “individualism” and “egotism”, \\nwhich weaken moral consciousness and disrupt social bonds. Another objection is that the \\nsocial technology needed to bring about public happiness will bring us a “Brave New \\nWorld”. \\n       On the other hand, several traditions in modern psychology predict positive effects: \\nhumanist psychologists believ e that happiness frees the way to “active involvement”, \\n“creativity” and “better personal re lations”. Current stress theory holds that positive attitudes \\nsuch as happiness “buffer” the impact of nega tive life events. Similarly, an accepted view in \\npsychosomatic theory is that chronic dissatis faction increases vulnerability to disease and \\npremature death! \\n \\n \\n8.2      Observed effects \\nAs yet no empirical investigations have  focused on consequences of happiness. \\nNevertheless, some indications can be f ound in the results of a few longitudinal \\ninvestigations on life sa tisfaction and experimental studies  on mood. These results suggest \\nthat a positive appreciation of life tends to br oaden perception rather than paralyse it, to \\nencourage active living rather than induce apathy a nd to foster social cont act rather than lead \\nto selfish individualism. There are strong indica tions that happiness fosters health and even \\nlengthens lives somewhat (resea rch reviewed in Veenhoven, 1988). \\nThese findings do not conclude the whole di scussion of whether happiness should be \\npromoted or not; they simply do away with  the argument that happiness is harmful. \\n \\n \\n \\n9.        CONCLUSIONS\\n \\nCenturies of thought about happiness have not be en without effect: we are now closer to an \\nanswer to seven longstanding questions: \\n \\n1. Major progress has been made in the concep tualization of happiness. We are now more \\naware of the varieties of well-being. This  enables more prec ise observation and \\nconsideration of the variable under discussion: i.e. life satisfaction. \\n2. The invention of survey research has al lowed the quantitative measurement of life \\nsatisfaction. Though not very precise, current interview te chniques seem to measure \\nhappiness reasonably validly. \\n3.  We are now able to answer the longs tanding question of whether people are \\ncharacteristically dissatisfied or not. Positive appreciation of life appears to be the rule. \\n4. In spite of great advances, we are largel y in the dark about how  people make up their \\nmind about their life-as-a-whole. Various plausi ble theories have been  proposed about the \\ncognitive processes involved. The origins of affective experience are still mysterious, as \\nwe do not know much about the neural physiology of happiness either. The promising \\nissue of “freezing” and “unfreezing” of attitude s towards life has hardly been explored at \\nall. \\n5. In spite of a wealth of corre lational research, we know very little about the conditions that \\nfoster a positive appreciation of life. What is lacking are follow up studies that can \\ndemonstrate causal effects and meta-analyse s that show variations across time and \\nRuut Veenhoven 13 Questions on happinessculture. For the time being, it seems that people f eel at their best when they live in a free, \\naffluent and peaceful society, when they are part of an intimate network and are \\nphysically and mentally healthy. \\n6. Current evidence does not support the old idea that happiness leve ls cannot be raised \\npermanently. Happiness is not a zero sum matter, nor a fixed trait, nor entirely relative. \\nPlanned promotion of the general public  happiness is possible in principle. \\n7. There is no evidence for the idea that happiness is harmful. Happiness does not numb or\\nlead to apathy. Rather, it seems to activate people, to foster social contacts and to benefit\\n health. Therefore, happiness is a matter worth promoting. \\n \\n \\nREFERENCES \\n \\nALLOY, L.B. and ABRAMSON, L.Y. (1979) \\nJudgments of contingency in depressed and non-depressed students.

Introduction\\nThe economics of happiness literature developed in the early\\nnineteen seventies with the pioneering work of such research-ers as Richard Easterlin. Easterlin and subsequent authors,such as Daniel Kahneman, believe that individual utility, tra-ditionally thought by economists to be immeasurable and\\nhence proxied by income, can be measured directly. One\\nmethod is to employ happiness data from surveys as empiricalapproximations of individual utility. The specific questionasked varies throughout the literature in terms of subjectmatter (questions on happiness and life satisfaction are fre-quently employed) and range of scale (three-point to ten-pointscales have been employed in the literature). These questionselicit happiness or life satisfaction from individuals and mea-sures such as these have been found to have a high scientificstandard in terms of internal consistency, reliability and vali-dity ( Diener et al., 1999 )\\n1and have been used extensively in the\\neconomics literature in recent decades (see, e.g., Easterlin,\\n1974; 1995; 2001 ,o rFrey and Stutzer, 2000; 2002a,b; 2004 ).\\nThis literature has examined the role of socio-economic\\nand socio-demographic variables on individual well-being.Established findings within the field include that character-\\nistics of the individuals themselves, their socio-demographic\\ncharacteristics, such as their age, gender and marital status,influence their happiness. Similarly for micro-economiccharacteristics, such as income, household tenure and em-ployment status, with unemployment having a profoundnegative influence on well-being. At the macro-economiclevel, contributions have focused on the impact of nationalinflation ( Di Tella et al., 2001 ) and unemployment ( Clark andECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 65 (2008) 386 –396\\n1Firstly, measures of life satisfaction show temporal reliability,\\neven over a period of several years; secondly, they covary with\\nratings made by family and friends, with interviewer ratings and\\nwith amount of smiling in an interview; and finally, when self-\\nreports of well-being are correlated with other methods ofmeasurement, they show adequate convergent validity ( Diener\\nand Suh, 1999).☆Financial support of the Environmental Protection Agency\\nERTDI program is gratefully acknowledged.\\n⁎Corresponding author.

Happiness is found\\nto be inversely related to the inflation and unemployment\\nrates, but to increase with the level of direct democracy.\\nPrior literature in the economics field has demonstrated\\nthat the area or location where an individual lives affectsquality of life. This is especially evident in the hedonic pricingliterature where there is a long tradition of constructing qua-lity of life indices as the weighted averages of amenities in aparticular area, usually a city or region (see Rosen, 1974;\\nRoback, 1982 orBlomquist et al., 1988 , for seminal contribu-\\ntions, and Chay and Greenstone, 2005 , for a recent state-of-\\nthe-art valuation exercise).\\n2\\nHowever, it wasn\\'t until the 1990s that researchers began to\\nexamine this spatial aspect of well-being in the economic\\npsychology literature. These more recent papers found that\\ncharacteristics of people\\'s immediate surroundings (theirlocality) influenced their well-being, but also that the widerenvironment had an important role to play in explaining whatmakes us happy. Environmental variables such as aircraftnoise ( van Praag and Baarsma, 2005 ), air pollution ( Welsch,\\n2002; 2006 ) and the prevailing climate ( Frijters and van Praag,\\n1998 and Rehdanz and Maddison, 2005 ) are found to influence\\nwelfare, as are environmental attitudes ( Ferrer-i-Carbonell and\\nGowdy, 2007 ). Findings indicate that excess noise levels ad-\\nversely affect well-being, as does air pollution and the influ-\\nence of climate depends on the variable in question, indicating\\nthe potential importance of spatial factors in determining well-being.\\nIn terms of examining the geography of well-being, pre-\\nvious studies were hindered by a lack of adequately disaggre-grated data ( Welsch, 2006; Rehdanz and Maddison, 2005 ). By\\nthe authors own admission, data constraints at the local andregional levels restricted their analysis to aggregated data atthe national level, or to focusing on a particular localised areawhere richer data was available. Hence, thus far, the currentliterature has stopped short of carrying out a holistic study of\\nthe spatial element of well-being, due in no small part to these\\ndata constrains, but also to the lack of availability of appro-priate tools to carry out such analysis. For example, Rehdanz\\nand Maddison (2005) examine the influence on well-being of\\nclimatic conditions, but including too many of their climatevariables in the model at once leads to problems of multi-collinearity as some of their climate variables did not vary atthe national level (i.e., one record per country). They state thattheir analysis was restricted to the country level and that itwould be interesting to see how climate would affect people\\'shappiness in different regions of a country. Ferrer-i-Carbonell\\nand Gowdy (2007) include a set of dummy variables indicating\\nthe region where the individual lives to capture the (natural)environment, proxying, for example, London and Manchesteras polluted areas. However, in the case of major cities in de-veloped countries, pollution is, generally, a localised phenom-enon and categorising an entire cities population under onepollution level may severely under or overestimate their expo-sure. Welsch (2006) uses life satisfaction scores to value air\\npollution in European countries, but includes no within coun-try variation in his estimation. Due to a lack of data, Welsch\\'sstudy was concerned with countries as the cross-sectionalunits and he states that “future research may address the\\nquestion how regional or local happiness profiles are affectedby the corresponding environmental conditions. It is conceiv-able that at a more disaggregated level the linkage betweenenvironment and happiness is even more articulate than it iswith respect to national data ”.van Praag and Baarsma (2005)\\nexamine a localised problem and use postcodes to link theirrespondents to objective noise burden, but due to issues ofanonymity, this application may only be available at city levelwhere populations are aggregated.\\nIn this paper, we explicitly endeavour to examine the\\nimportance of space in the determination of well-being, using\\na more holistic approach. Firstly, we measure amenities at the\\nlevel of disaggregation at which individuals actually experi-ence their surroundings, i.e. local level. This is facilitatedthrough the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), asystem for the visual display of spatial data. Using GIS, 1) thelevel of disaggregation at which individuals are linked to theirsurroundings is greatly improved; 2) the vector of spatialvariables included in the happiness function is expanded toinclude variables with a potential influence on well-being, butwhich have not been examined to date; and 3) distance mea-sures are introduced, as one could hypothesize that the inten-\\nsity at which individuals experience their surroundings is a\\nfunction of proximity (as in the case of air pollution and noise).The findings in the paper highlight the critical importance ofthe role of the spatial dimension in determining well-being,i.e., spatial variables are found to be highly significant withlarge coefficients. We also find that the impact of spatialamenities on life satisfaction is a function of distance, with themost notable example being that of proximity to coast. Thishas a large positive effect, which diminishes as one movesfurther from the coast. The results may have potentially im-portant implications for the setting of public policy, e.g. deci-\\nsions affecting the location of amenities negatively impacting\\non well-being, such as waste facilities. Most importantly, theexplanatory power of our happiness function significantlyincreases when the spatial variables are included, resulting inthree-times the variation in well-being being explained thanhas been achieved in any previous cross-sectional study. Thisindicates that geography and the environment have a muchlarger influence on well-being than previously thought.\\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the\\nmethodology (data, GIS requirements and the estimation stra-tegy) used in the paper, Section 3 presents the results and\\nSection 4 concludes.\\n2Roback (1982) found that the average person in her sample\\nwould be willing to pay $69.55 per year for an additional clear day,\\n$78.25 per year to avoid an additional cloudy day, and $5.55 per\\nyear to avoid an increase of 1 μg per cubic meter in particulate\\nmatter. Blomquist et al. (1988) found that the difference in\\ncompensation between the most and least desirable U.S. counties\\nin terms of the same bundle of local amenities comprising\\nclimate, urban conditions and environmental quality was $5,146.More recently, Berger et al. (2003) have shown that one standard\\ndeviation changes in climate attributes (heating degree days), airquality and crime produce annual compensation in the Russianhousing and labor markets of 7,839, 8,050 and 8,602 rublesrespectively, compared to a mean monthly salary of 1928 rubles.387 ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 65 (2008) 386– 3962. Methodology\\nIn this paper, we assume that the level of well-being attained\\nby an individual iin location kcan be represented by the\\nfollowing indirect utility function:\\nui;k¼aþb0xi;kþ/C130ai;kþ\"i;ki¼1::::I;k¼1; ::::;K ð1Þ\\nwhere udenotes utility of individual iin location k,ais a vector\\nof spatial factors, some of which (e.g., commuting time, pro-\\nximity to a coast) may vary at an individual level and xis a vector\\nof socio-economic and demographic characteristics (age, genderetc.) that are typically included in the literature (see, e.g., Clark\\nand Oswald, 1994; Di Tella et al., 2001 orStutzer, 2004 ). In the\\nmicro-econometric function, the individual\\'s true utility isunobservable, hence we use self-reported well-being as a proxy.\\nThe well-being indicator (or proxy for individual utility) used\\nin this paper is based on the answers to the following question(which was preceded by a range of questions regarding variousaspects of the respondent\\'s life): ‘Thinking about the good and\\nbad things in your life, which of these answers best describesyour life as a whole? ’. Respondents could choose a category on a\\nscale of one to seven ( ‘As bad as can be ’;‘very bad ’;‘bad ’;‘alright ’;\\n‘good ’;‘very good ’;‘as good as can be ’).\\n3The use of self-reported\\nwell-being introduces measurement error as the respondentsmay be unable to communicate accurately their underlyingutility level. However, as Blanchflower and Oswald (2004a) point\\nout, it is measurement error in the independent variables thatwould be more problematic in the econometric estimation, andthere is a broad consensus among previous studies that self-reported well-being is a satisfactory empirical proxy of individ-\\nual utility (see, e.g., Stutzer, 2004; Blanchflower and Oswald,\\n2004b; Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Frijters, 2004 ). Additionally, the\\nuse of a latent variable framework (i.e. Ordered Probit) controls\\nfor measurement error in the dependent variable.\\nData on well-being and on the socio-demographic and\\nsocio-economic characteristics used in the analysis comefrom a survey\\n4of a representative sample of 1,5005men and\\nwomen, aged 18 and over and living in Ireland. The surveyfound a high well-being, in general, in Ireland with an averageof 5.5 on the seven-point scale. What makes this data setparticularly well suited for this paper is that it can be merged\\nwith detailed geographical information as we know the area in\\nwhich the respondent lives. This information allows us tomatch the survey data spatially to a national map of Irelandusing GIS and hence it is possible to combine subjective data atthe individual level with a vector of spatial amenities ( a).\\n6\\nThese two datasets are combined at the local (electoraldivision)\\n7level. However, to assess properly the impact on\\nindividual well-being from changes in spatial amenities,ideally, one would want to be able to match climate andenvironmental factors to a particular individual rather than aparticular area. At present, however, the data do not allow thisand anonymity may preclude this in any case. Descriptions ofthe variables and descriptive statistics are outlined in\\nAppendix A.\\nThe use of data collected in Ireland is interesting in its own\\nright. In the last decade, the ‘Celtic Tiger ’economy grew at a\\nrecord rate for a developed country (this and other trends aredocumented in, for example, Clinch et al., 2002 ). Meanwhile,\\ntheEconomist Intelligence Unit (2004) has ranked Ireland as\\nfirst in its quality of life league table for 2005. Nevertheless,there has been much concern regarding the implications of thepace of economic growth for localized environmental qualityand life satisfaction generally ( EPA, 2004 ). This makes Ireland\\nan appropriate subject for the analysis of the influence ofspatial amenities on subjective well-being. Furthermore,issues surrounding heterogeneity of preferences may not beas problematic in a small (approximately 70,000 km\\n2) and\\nrelatively homogenous country like Ireland, compared to othernations. Also, by examining one country, issues of translation\\nand cultural bias in the well-being question should not arise.\\n8\\nAs elements of the vector of spatial factors, we include\\nthose variables which previous literature has shown to be\\nimportant determinants of well-being. Roback (1982) includes\\nthe crime rate, population density and climatic conditions toconstruct Quality of Life indices for US cities using the hedonicpricing method. Blomquist et al. (1988) include similar\\nvariables in their analysis, also of US cities, but in additionthey include the presence of waste facilities and proximity tocoast. More recently, research in the economics of happinesshas shown proximity to transport routes to affect well-being\\n(van Praag and Baarsma, 2005 ).\\nThe dataset contains climate (from Collins and Cummins,\\n1996 ), environmental (from EPA, 2005 ) and other spatial data\\n(Urbis Database, 2006 ). Several climate variables were consid-\\nered but following the advice of a climatologist, mean annual\\nprecipitation, January mean daily minimum air temperature,July mean daily maximum air temperature, mean annualduration of bright sunshine and mean annual wind speed\\n3Some studies treat self-reported life satisfaction data and\\nhappiness data interchangeably. Veenhoven (1997) states that\\n“the word life-satisfaction denotes the same meaning and is often\\nused interchangeably with happiness. ”Di Tella et al. (2001) report\\na correlation coefficient of 0.56. However, Peiro (2006) points to\\nhappiness and satisfaction as two distinct spheres of well-being.\\nHe concludes that the first would be relatively independent of\\neconomic factors while the second would be strongly dependent.\\n4Urban Institute Ireland National Survey on Quality of Life (2001) .\\n5Due to missing observations the final sample consists of ap-\\nproximately (depending on the model specification) 1,467 observa-tions. The effective response rate is 66.6%. The margin of error\\nusing the entire sample is ± 2.5% at a 95% confidence level. The2000 Register of Electors was used as the sampling frame.6GIS works well when applied to static data, and less well when\\napplied to time series analysis ( Goodchild and Haining, 2004) and\\nhence is well-suited to the cross-sectional data employed in this\\npaper.\\n7There are around 3,440 electoral divisions in Ireland which\\nrepresent the smallest enumeration area used by the Irish Central\\nStatistics Office in the collection of Census data. These areas are\\nrelatively small, particularly in the city regions and those\\nrepresented in our sample range in size from 18ha (in cities) to6,189ha (open countryside) (mean = 1,767, standard deviation =\\n1,538), with total populations ranging from 47 individuals to 8,595\\n(mean = 2,040, standard deviation = 2,073).\\n8However, the extent to which these biases are problematic is a\\nmatter of debate ( Diener and Suh, 1999).388 ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 65 (2008) 386 –396were chosen (similar to those included in Frijters and van\\nPraag, 1998 ).\\nAs in Blomquist et al. (1988) , variables capturing whether the\\nrespondent lives near the coast, the violent crime rate and pres-\\nence of waste facilities in the respondent\\'s area were included.\\nThere is evidence suggesting that noise, smell and othernegative externalities from waste facilities may impact nega-tively on well-being or quality of life ( DG Environment, 2000 ). Air\\npollution and water quality were considered as indicators ofenvironmental quality but regional variation is minimal ( EPA,\\n2004). Additionally, population density (total population dividedby total area in km\\n2(CSO, 2003 )), traffic congestion and average\\ncommuting time in each area were included to capture crowdingand congestion effects. Also, a variable capturing voter turnoutin the Irish general election in 2002 ( Kavanagh et al., 2004 )i s\\nincluded as an indicator for social capital (as in Putnam, 2000 ).\\nDue to data constraints, traffic congestion (number of vehicles(DELG, 2002a,b) divided by the total length of primary roads per\\nlocal authority\\n9area ( NRA, 2003 )) and the homicide rate (number\\nof homicides per 100,000 of population ( Garda Siochana, 2002 ))\\nare measured at the local authority level.\\nAs in van Praag and Baarsma (2005) , we include proximity to\\nairports.10However, we also include more detailed transport\\ndata consisting of proximity to: major roads (national primaryand national secondary) ( NRA, 2003 ); international, national\\nand regional airports; railway stations, and seaports ( Urbis\\nDatabase, 2006 ). Access to transport routes could potentially\\nenter the micro-econometric function in two ways, positivelythrough accessibility and negatively through pollution andnoise. The latter was shown to be the case by van Praag and\\nBaarsma (2005) in relation to airport noise in Amsterdam.\\nAs for the socio-economic and demographic variables, the\\ndataset includes an employment-status variable divided intoten separate categories which follow the International LabourOrganisation (ILO) classification: employed (self-employed,full-time employed and part-time employed), inactive (stu-dent, working on home duties, disabled, retired, those not\\nworking and not seeking work, and those on a government\\ntraining scheme) or unemployed ( CSO, 2006 ). Unemployment\\nis further divided into two categories of those unemployedhaving lost or given up their job combined with those notworking but seeking work, and those seeking work for the firsttime. Additional individual characteristics contained in thedataset and typically employed in the literature are age,gender, educational attainment (primary, lower secondary/junior high school, upper secondary/senior high school anduniversity degree), marital status (single, married, cohabiting,widowed and separated/divorced), log of gross householdincome,\\n11whether the respondent is caring for a disabled\\nmember of the family and the number of dependent childrenin the household (1, 2, 3+). As an indicator of individual healthwe use the number of times the respondent has visited the\\ndoctor in the past year (never or once, two to five times and\\nsix or more times a year). We also include household tenure(owned outright, mortgaged, renting, or in public housing).\\n2.1. Geographical Information Systems methodology\\nGIS is a powerful computing tool that allows the visual repre-\\nsentation of spatially referenced data. It has advanced the tech-nical ability to handle such data as countable numbers of points,lines and polygons\\n12in two-dimensional space (Goodchild and\\nHaining, 2004 ) and link various datasets using spatial identifiers\\n(Bond and Devine, 1991 ). It represents a solid base for spatial data\\nanalysis and provides a range of techniques for analysis andvisualisation of spatial data. It provides effective decision supportthrough its database management capabilities, graphical userinterfaces and cartographic visualisation ( Wu et al., 2001 ).\\n2.1.1. GIS in the economics literature\\nResearch using GIS in the economics field has tended to be inthe area of environmental valuation through hedonic pricingand a new generation of hedonic studies is using GIS to createlarger databases and define new explanatory variables in\\ncombination with spatial econometric methods (see Bateman\\net al., 2002; Lake et al., 1998 ). These hedonic models use a GIS\\nprogramme to develop neighbourhood characteristics that are\\nunique to each of their included observations (i.e. house orproperty). GIS has enhanced the ability of these hedonicmodels to explain variation in sale prices by considering bothproximity to, and extent of, environmental attributes ( Paterson\\nand Boyle, 2002 ).\\nBaranzini and Ramirez (2005) use GIS to value the impact of\\nnoise in Geneva, while Lynch and Rasmussen (2001) use GIS to\\nestimate the impact of crime on house prices in Jacksonville,\\nFlorida, USA. Paterson and Boyle (2002) use GIS data to develop\\nvariables representing the physical extent and visibility of\\nsurrounding land use in a hedonic model of a rural/suburbanresidential housing market. Bastian et al. (2002) use GIS data to\\nmeasure recreational and scenic amenities associated withrural land, while Geoghegan et al. (1997) developed GIS data for\\ntwo landscape indices and incorporated them in a hedonicmodel for Washington D.C, USA.\\n2.1.2. Creating variables using GIS\\nTo capture accurately the influence of environmental and\\nlocation specific variables on individual well-being requires\\nvariables to be measured at a high level of disaggregation i.e. at\\n9For governance purposes, Ireland is divided into 34 different\\nregions called Local Authority areas. These generally equate to\\none body per county and one for the three major urban areas ofGalway City, Limerick City and Cork City. Dublin is divided into\\nfour areas and Tipperary is divided into two local authority areas.\\nThese areas are relatively large and range in size from 2,035ha to746,797ha (mean = 229,060, standard deviation = 226,508), withtotal populations ranging from 25,799 individuals to 495,781\\n(mean = 177,377, standard deviation = 135,990).\\n10All the proximity criteria are based on guidelines in Irish\\nGovernment policy documents (see, DELG, 2002b ).11Income is expressed in thousands of euro. Missing values,\\n23.7% of those interviewed, were imputed based on the respon-dent\\'s socio-demographic characteristics including age, gender,\\nmarital status, education level, area inhabited and employmentstatus. The original income variable was divided in 10 categories,\\nso mid-points were used (as in Stutzer, 2004). The survey was\\ncarried out when Ireland was still using the Irish Pound, so we\\nconverted to euros using the fixed rate of IR£1 = €1.26974.\\n12A polygon is the GIS term for any multi sided figure.389 ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS 65 (2008) 386– 396the level at which individuals experience their environment.\\nTherefore they must be captured in a manner that reflectsindividuals\\' perceptions of the amenity or disamenity in ques-tion. Many facets of an amenity, such as intensity, frequency,\\nduration, variability, time of occurrence during the day etc.\\n(Bateman et al., 2001 ) will affect how an individual perceives\\nthe amenity. GIS allows variables to be related spatially andhence individuals can be linked to the geographic character-istics of their surroundings. Hence, GIS could, in principle,provide a full quantitative description of overall area quality ifall relevant data layers, for example concerning road networksand public services, were available and were transformed in aconvenient way into spatial attributes ( Din et al., 2001 ).\\nHowever, when specific household or property GeoCodes\\n(X,Ycoordinates) are unknown, as in the case of the house-\\nhold survey data used in this paper, neighbourhood areasmust be used as the reference point when creating environ-mental variables. The typical method of doing this is to usethe mathematically-created centre or ‘centroid’ of the area in\\nquestion\\n13(as was the case in Craglia et al., 2001 ,w h os t u d y\\nhigh intensity crime areas in England) and in this paperwe use the centroid of the respondents\\' electoral division.This introduces a maximum measurement error equal to thegreatest distance between the centroid and the border of theelectoral division in question which will be greatest in ruralareas and smallest in the city regions.\\nThe GIS requirements for this paper included the collection,\\nassimilation and pre-processing of digital, spatial datasets,development of methods for spatio-temporal analysis andproduction of summary statistics and cartographic representa-tions. Thisprocess producedlayers of data which were ‘mapped ’\\ninto ArcView GIS. The data were entered into GIS as points (e.g.the location of waste facilities), lines (e.g. roads), or polygons(e.g. airports) within the categories of: meteorological; environ-mental; transport; and administrative boundary data layers.Different variables were entered in different ways. Some wereentered directly as the spatial coordinates for this data were\\nknown, such as the airport co-ordinates. Others, such as the\\nclimate layers were entered as raster maps and these wereconverted to polygons for analysis purposes, as it was thenpossible to link individuals to characteristics of their areas. Alldata were converted to Irish National Grid co-ordinates.\\nOnce the data layers were entered into the ArcView system,\\nvariables were created to allow statistical analysis to takeplace. For example, proximity to coast is measured as threedummy variables; less than two kilometres from the coast,between two and five kilometres and more than five kilo-metres. This allows us to examine if the amenity/disamenity\\nvalues of the variables are functions of distance. We can also\\ndisaggregate between different types of similar amenities e.g.landfill and hazardous waste sites ( EPA, 2005 ). Using proximity\\ntools within ArcMap, distance ‘buffers ’were created from the\\ncentroid (as in Craglia et al., 2001 ) of each specific electoral\\ndivision to a specified distance. Buffer analysis allows the\\nresearcher to take a point or line feature and generate a\\npolygon containing all the area within a certain distance of thefeature ( Bond and Devine, 1991 ). A tool called ‘select by\\nlocation ’, was then used to identify the area where a particular\\nenvironmental condition is satisfied. The variables createdwere either entered as columns of 0s and 1s, i.e. where thedummy equaled 1 for a particular electoral division if thecondition was satisfied and 0 otherwise (e.g., 1 if an electoraldivision was within a 50 km radius of an airport and 0otherwise) or as continuous variables (as in the case of theclimate variables). These variables were then exported to the\\nstatistical software package STATA so econometric analysis\\ncould be carried out.\\n2.2. Estimation strategy\\nThe stated aim of this paper is to examine the influence ofspace and place on individual well-being. As a first steptowards capturing this influence, a micro-econometric happi-ness function is specified (Model 1) in which we distinguishbetween two distinct geographical areas of Ireland, i.e.,between those respondents living in Dublin and those living\\nin the rest of the country. This split was considered appropriate\\nin a small (approximately 70,000 km\\n2) and relatively homog-\\nenous country like Ireland where the Dublin area comprises28% of the population in only 1.3% of the land area, accounts for39% of the national total of Gross Value Added and, with apopulation of 1.122 million, is the only urban area with apopulation in excess of 150,000. In Model 1, which also controlsfor a broad range of socio-economic and socio-demographiccharacteristics of the individuals in question (age, age-squared, gender, employment status, educational attainment,health, marital status, income, number of dependent children\\nand household tenure), a dummy for Dublin might be seen as a\\nrough summary measure of the amenities in that area.However, it does not provide much information regardingwhich specific amenities are most valued by the individuals.Therefore, in order to determine which site-specific factors aremost relevant to well-being, a subsequent model is estimated(Model 2), corresponding to the estimation of Eq. (1), where thespatial variables equate to the amenities contained in vector a.\\nThis model contains the spatial amenities created using GISand other data at the electoral division level.\\nFinally, because the regressions combine data at different\\nlevels of disaggregation (individual, electoral division andlocal authority levels), the standard errors in all the regres-sions are corrected for clustering ( Moulton, 1990 ).\\n3.

Forexample, the coefficient on being unemployed is negative andsignificant and, everything else being equal, reduces lifesatisfaction substantially (see e.g., Blanchflower and Oswald,\\n2004a for similar results). Gender is significant and negative,\\nindicating that males are less satisfied with their lives thanfemales. Except for the study of Alesina et al. (2004) that finds\\ngender to be significantly related to life satisfaction in the USA,in previous studies gender tends to emerge as insignificant inlife satisfaction regressions ( Stutzer, 2004; Frey and Stutzer,\\n2000; Di Tella et al., 2001 ). We find that those with lower (junior\\nhigh school) or higher (senior high school) education are moresatisfied with life than those with a primary education level(similar to Frey and Stutzer, 2000 ). As in Clark and Oswald\\n(1994) and Blanchflower and Oswald (2004b) , being separated\\nor divorced is negative and significant. However, we find nodifference between married and single respondents. Havingthree or more children is negative and significant at the 5%\\nlevel (similar to Clark and Oswald, 1994 ). Respondents visiting\\ntheir doctor two or more times a year are found to be less\\nsatisfied with life than those not attending or attending onlyonce. Living in public housing is significant and negativelyrelated to life satisfaction at the 1% level with a largecoefficient. Perhaps surprisingly, being the carer of a disabledfamily member emerges as positive and significant in theregression. In line with the standard textbook prediction ofutility as an increasing function of income, our proxy for utility(life satisfaction) is an increasing function of (log) income,\\nwhich emerges significant at the 1% level. Age emerges\\ninsignificant in the regression. This is in contrast to the inter-national literature which, generally, finds a U-shaped associ-ation between life satisfaction and age.\\nExamining the influence of location on well-being, we find the\\ncoefficient on the dummy variable for Dublin to be highlysignificant and large; only the coefficients for being unemployedand a discouraged worker are larger in magnitude. Everythingelse being equal, those living in a ll areas outside Dublin have a\\nhigher life satisfaction. This result is similar to that in Ferrer-i-\\nCarbonell and Gowdy (2007) , who find individuals living in Inner\\nLondon to be less happy, everything else equal.\\nHaving controlled for a large number of socio-economic and\\nsocio-demographic characteristics, a reasonable hypothesis isthat factors related to the size of the settlement and otherlocation-specific factors may be responsible for lower life-satisfaction levels in Dublin. For example, compared to anyother area in the country, unparalleled growth rates haveresulted in the capital having a much higher populationdensity than other areas and a significant traffic congestionproblem ( DELG, 2002b ). To test this hypothesis, Model 2\\nexamines the importance of spatial amenities.\\n3.2. Model 2\\nModel 2, the results of which are reported in the last column ofTable 1 , corresponds to Eq. (1). It builds on Model 1 by including\\nthe variables with a spatial influence on well-being. Theseinclude population density, congestion, commuting time andthe climatic and environmental variables. In this model, thedummy for Dublin loses its significance. This result suggeststhat the spatial variables explain an important part of thedifference between living in Dublin and other regions of\\nIreland in terms of well-being.\\n15\\nThe pseudo- R2of Model 2, at 0.16, exceeds all those obtained to\\ndate in the international literature using a cross-sectional dataset.\\nFor example, Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Gowdy (2007) in their study of\\nsubjective well-being and environmental attitudes, obtain apseudo- R\\n2of 0.088.

This resultmay, however, be driven by a positive correlation between rainand scenic beauty.\\n17The most spectacular landscapes in\\nIreland are found in the wettest counties in the West ofIreland. Rehdanz and Maddison (2005) find very scarce pre-\\ncipitation reduces happiness, which they hypothesize mightreflect the fact that climate could have an indirect effect on\\nhappiness through landscape effects. However, in our case the\\ncoefficient emerges insignificant at conventional levels.Increases in the January minimum and July maximum tem-peratures emerge as amenities and increase life satisfaction.Wind speed emerges negative and significant in our regres-sion, while surprisingly, we find that total annual sunshine isnegatively related to life satisfaction. However, it may be thatthis result is driven by the correlation between elements ofrainfall not captured in our variable (e.g., intensity andfrequency) and sunshine.\\nAs in the hedonic literature (e.g., Blomquist et al., 1988 ), we\\nfind the presence of waste facilities in an individual\\'s area to\\nbe a disamenity. However, the type of, and distance from, the\\nwaste facility in question matters. The coefficient on thevariable capturing if a landfill site is in operation in therespondent\\'s electoral division emerges negative and signif-icant compared to those who live in electoral divisions morethan ten kilometres away. There is evidence suggesting thatnoise, smell and other negative externalities from wastefacilities of this kind may impact negatively on well-being orquality of life ( DG Environment, 2000 ). Proximity to landfillsites has been the subject of many hedonic analyses, such asBlomquist et al. (1988) who use the number of landfill sites per\\ncapita as a variable to construct Quality of Life indices, alsoNelson et al. (1992) andHavlicek (1985) who examine the price\\neffects of landfills on house values in US cities. Proximity to ahazardous waste facility however, does not seem to have ani n f l u e n c ei nt e r m so fl i f es a t i s f a c t i o n .I tm a yb et h a tindividuals are less aware of the presence of these facilitiesin their areas. The coefficient on population density is positiveand significant at the 10% level. This result is similar to that ofRoback (1982) , who finds population density to be an amenity.\\nAverage commuting time and congestion emerge insignificantin the regression as does the crime rate.\\nProximity to coast emerges positive and significant with a\\nlarge coefficient, indicating that individuals living near the\\ncoast enjoy higher life satisfaction, other things being equal.\\nAdditionally there is evidence that the utility value of coast is afunction of distance with respondents living two kilometres orless from the coast more satisfied with their lives, compared tothose living more than five kilometres from the coast. Thoseliving between two and five kilometres from the coast are alsomore satisfied, if insignificantly so, but the coefficient isreduced. Interestingly, proximity to beach emerges insignifi-cant in the regression. It may be that, given Ireland\\'s climate,the amenity value of coastal areas is not a function of theavailability of a beach.\\nWe find access to transport emerges as both an amenity and\\ndisamenity, depending on the type of, and distance from, theamenity in question. Life satisfaction is highest for those livingbetween thirty and sixty kilometres from an internationalairport. It may be that those less than thirty kilometres awayare affected by the noise disamenity. In relation to regionalairports, the amenity value lies at less than thirty kilometres.This result is not unexpected as these are small airports and onlydeal with smaller, less noisy aircraft and would have signifi-cantly fewer arrivals and departures than do the larger airports.Close proximity to a major road (less than five kilometres)\\nemerges as a disamenity, again with distance decay. This may be\\ncapturing the noise affects of this transport route. Closeproximity to a seaport emerges insignificant in the regression.\\n4. Conclusion\\nIn this paper we adopt a holistic approach to the examinationof the influence of geography and the environment onhappiness. Using GIS we are able to overcome many of thedifficulties that have prevented previous researchers addres-sing this issue comprehensively. This is achieved by matchingindividuals to their surroundings at a higher level of disag-gregration and by expanding the vector of spatial variables\\nincluded in the happiness function. We also use proximity\\nmeasures to examine if the influence of spatial amenities onlife satisfaction is a function of distance.\\nThe findings show that climate has a significant influence on\\nwell-being, with wind speed negative and significant, butincreases in both January minimum temperature and Julymaximum temperature are positive and significant. Access tomajor transport routes and proximity to coast and to wastefacilities all influence well-being.

Proximity to landfill is found to have anegative affect on well-being. Proximity to coast has a largepositive effect, but its influence is a diminishing function of\\ndistance. Additionally, the impact of proximity to major\\ntransport routes has different effects depending on the type of,and distance to, the amenity in question, e.g., while reasonableproximity to international airports increases well-being, closeproximity to major roads decreases it. It may be that, in theformer case, the positive effect of access outweighs the negativeeffect of noise, while the opposite may be true in the latter case.These results may have potentially important implications forthe setting of public policy, such as the location of wastefacilities, the routing of major roads, location of airports etc., soas to have as minimal negative impact as possible on well-being.\\nOur findings highlight the critical importance of the role of the\\nspatial dimension in determining well-being, i.e., spatial vari-ables are found to be highly significant with large coefficients. Infact, the explanatory power of our happiness function substan-tially increases when the spatial variables are included, resultingin three-times the variation in well-being being explained thanhas been achieved in any previous cross-sectional study. Thisindicates that geography and the environment have a muchlarger influence on well-being than previously thought, as im-portant as the most critical socio-economic and socio-demo-graphic factors, such as unemployment and marital status. This\\nfinding has potentially important implications for setting\\npriorities for public policy as, in essence, improving well-beingcould be considered to be the ultimate goal of public policy.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Andrew Oswald, Michael Hanemann, Mirko Moro,Alan Carr and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.We thank Daniel McInerney and Sean Morrish for technicalassistance.

First, presumably\\nthis subject really matters. Second, psychologists have for many years worked with data on self-reportedhappiness. They ought to know more about human psychology than we do. Third, there are grounds – laidout later – to believe that subjective well-being can be studied in a systematic way. Well-being regressionequations have the same structure all over the world. Fourth, subjective wellbeing measures are correlatedwith observable phenomena. For example, people who report high happiness scores tend to laugh and smilemore, and to be rated by others as happier (Pavot, 1991; Diener, 1984; Watson and Clark, 1991). Fifth, we\\nmight be able to use happiness data to test old ideas in new ways. For example, if one wished to know whetherinﬂation is bad, one might ask whether, in inﬂationary periods, people en masse unknowingly tick lower down\\ntheir happiness score sheets (Di Tella et al,1996).\\n[1815 ]Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/107/445/1815/5063980 by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology user on 17 November 2024\\n1816\\nMost politicians who pronounce about the economic matters of the day do\\nso under a set of assumptions about human enjoyment that are usually notarticulated to the listener. The chief of these, perhaps, is the belief that byraising its output and productivity a society truly betters itself. Real income hasbeen rising in the Western countries for a long time. Like most otherindustrialized nations, Britain is approximately twice as rich as it was asrecently as 1960, and almost three times richer than after the War. Has this\\nnew real income – an enormous improvement by the standards of the lastfew centuries – bought extra happiness? If so, how much, and whatshould governments now be trying to do? If not, why not, and what shouldgovernments now be trying to do?\\nDeciding how much authentic well-being is bought by economic progress is\\na diﬃcult task. It seems logically necessary, however, if economic and socialpolicy is to be designed in a rational way. If taxpayers’ pound notes can bethought of as seed-corn, they could be scattered upon ground devoted to raisinginnovation and economic growth, or, for example, upon that aimed atcombating social problems, or upon something diﬀerent. Society has to pickthose places to throw the seed-corn especially thickly. It is not easy to knowhow such choices can be made in a systematic way. However, a social scientistmight help those who mould policy if he or she could point to unnoticedpatterns in data on happiness and satisfaction. This paper takes a small stepalong that path.\\ni.happiness and real income in the united states\\nLater pages use the answers that people give when asked questions about how\\nhappy they fell with life or how satisﬁed they feel with their job and work.There are limitations to such statistics, but, if the aim is to learn about whatmakes people tick, listening to what they say seems likely to be a naturalﬁrst step. Sources of information exist that have for many years recordedindividuals’ survey responses to questions about subjective well-being. Theseresponses have been studied intensively by psychologists, #studied a little by\\nsociologists, and ignored by economists. $Some economists may wish to defend\\nthis neglect by emphasising the unreliability of such data. Most, however, areprobably unaware that data of this sort are available, and have not thought ofhow such empirical measures might be used in their discipline.\\nRichard Easterlin ( 1974,1995) was one of the ﬁrst economists to study\\nstatistics over time on the reported level of happiness. His data came from theUnited States. Easterlin’s 1974paper’s main objectives were, ﬁrst, to suggest\\nthat individual happiness appears to be the same across poor countries and richcountries, and, second, to argue that economic growth does not raise well-being. Easterlin suggested that we should think of people as getting utility froma comparison of themselves with others close to them: happiness is relative. The\\n#Recent work includes Argyle ( 1989), Douthitt et al.(1992), Fox and Kahneman ( 1992), Larsen et al.\\n(1984) and Mullis ( 1992).

A similar theme is taken up in Hirsch(1976) and Scitvosky ( 1976), and still more recently in Frank ( 1985).%\\nEasterlin ( 1974) suggested a test for whether greater riches had made\\nAmericans happier. He looked at whether reported happiness rose as nationalincome did. His paper concludes: ‘…in the one time series studied, that for theUnited States since 1946, higher income was not systematically accompanied\\nby greater happiness’ (p. 118). This result would mean that economic growth\\ndoes not buy well-being.\\nUnfortunately, it is not obvious that Easterlin’s data entirely support his\\nconclusion. For example, his longest consistent set of happiness levels show the\\nfollowing for the percentages of Americans saying they were ‘very happy’ and‘not very happy’ (the highest and lowest of three bands into which they couldplace themselves):\\nHappiness in the United States \\x81\\x89\\x84/zerooldstyleits–\\x81\\x89\\x85/zerooldstyleits\\nDate % Very happy % Not very happy N\\n1946 39 10 3 ,151\\n1947 42 10 1 ,434\\n1948 43 11 1 ,596\\n1952 47 9 3 ,003\\n1956 53 5 1 ,979\\n1957 53 3 1 ,627\\nSource: Table 8of Easterlin ( 1974) using US AIPO poll data.\\nOther data – using statistics with breaks and changes in deﬁnitions – given by\\nEasterlin diﬀer.

According to these data, well-being didrise through time in the United States. &\\nA more modern calculation can be done with the General Social Surveys of\\nthe United States, which have for many years been interviewing peopleannually about their levels of happiness. These surveys are of randomly selectedsamples of Americans, so the information they provide can be treated asrepresentative of the nation as a whole.

(GSS Ques.\\n154–6)\\nThe ﬁrst thing that is noticeable is that ‘pretty happy’ is the typical answer,\\nand that ‘not too happy’, which is the lowest score people can assignthemselves, is given by slightly more than a tenth of the population.\\nFirst indications from Table 1are not encouraging to the idea that growth\\nleads to more well-being. There is little sign of a time trend in the answer ‘veryhappy’. The proportion of American respondents saying this was around onethird both early in the 1970s and late in the 1980s. Over the period, however,\\na declining number of people seem to say that they are not too happy, and morestate that they are pretty happy.\\nThe raw data are consistent with the view that the category ‘pretty happy’\\nis expanding while ‘not too happy’ is shrinking. Nevertheless, the eﬀect is notdramatic, and these are only raw data that may be being mouldedpredominantly by a population that is changing its composition. Blanchﬂoweret al.(1993) explore the matter more systematically. They examine whether\\nthere is an upward trend in well-being after controlling for demographic andother compositional changes in the American economy. Their conclusion isthat there is a positive time trend, but that it is very slight. Intriguingly, thereseems to be evidence of a cycle in happiness (especially for men). Blanchﬂoweret al. show that the rise in happiness has not been spread evenly. It seems that\\nAmerican men have got happier while American women have experiencedlittle growth in subjective well-being. Blanchﬂower and Oswald ( 1996) ﬁnd\\nsome evidence that the young are growing relatively happier.\\nThese results are not consistent with the conclusion of Easterlin ( 1974) that,\\nperhaps because of ever-increasing aspirations and concern for relativities, thehuman lot does not improve over time. They are more like the arguments ofAndrews ( 1991) and Veenhoven ( 1991). Nevertheless, Easterlin was on the\\nright track. It may be correct to suggest that little national happiness is boughtby rising national income.\\nFinding 1 .Happiness With life appears to be increasing in the United States .The rise\\nis so small ,hoWe\\x8aer,that it seems extra income is not contributing dramaticall \\x92to the\\nqualit\\x92of people ’sl i\\x8aes.\\n#Royal Economic Society 1997the economic journal [novemberDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/107/445/1815/5063980 by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology user on 17 November 2024\\n1819 1997] happiness and economic performance\\nii.satisfaction with life :europe since 1973\\nThere is similar information for European countries. Although few economists\\nseem to have used the data, the Eurobarometer Survey Series asks:\\nOn the whole, are you very satisﬁed, fairly satisﬁed, not very satisﬁed, or\\nnot at all satisﬁed with the life you lead?\\nAnswers are available for random samples, from 1973 to the present, of\\napproximately 1,000people per year per country. The nations are Belgium,\\nDenmark, West Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,The Netherlands, Portugal and Great Britain. Surveys have been held twice ayear in each European Community country. Because of their late entry to theEC, there is no full run of data for Spain, Portugal and Greece. A valuablesource of information about the Eurobarometer surveys is the comprehensivestudy by Inglehart ( 1990), who uses them to study changing cultural values.\\nTable 2reports some of the data on life satisfaction for these countries. The\\nﬁrst thing that is obvious is the large diﬀerences across nations. In Denmark,for example, more than half the population say they are ‘very satisﬁed’, whilein Italy the ﬁgure is around one in ten. These divergent numbers are likely toreﬂect cultural and linguistic diﬀerences. This is partly the diﬃculty oftranslation (words like happiness, contentment and satisfaction have subtledistinctions in English, and in other languages). But it is not all variation inlanguage. As Inglehart ( 1990) points out, Switzerland makes an ideal\\nlaboratory to test this. German-speaking Swiss, French-speaking Swiss, andItalian-speaking Swiss all express higher satisfaction levels than do nativeGermans, French and Italians.\\nTable 2\\nLife Satisfaction in Nine European Countries from One Decade to the Next\\nCountry Average % 1973–81 Average % 1982–90Well-being increased?\\nProportion of the sample who reported themselves as ‘very satisﬁed’ with their lives\\nBelgium 39±52 4 ±7 No\\nDenmark 51±76 2 ±8 Yes\\nFrance 12±41 3 ±7 Yes\\nWest Germany 18±82 3 ±4 Yes\\nIreland 38±83 1 ±1 No\\nItaly 9±01 3 ±2 Yes\\nLuxembourg 34±63 9 ±1 Yes\\nNetherlands 41±34 1 ±8 Yes\\nUK 31±73 0 ±9 No\\nSource: Own calculations using Eurobarometer Survey numbers provided by Ronald Inglehart of the\\nUniversity of Michigan.

Over the ensuing decade, this ﬁgure dropped dramatically. For 1982–90,\\nthe proportion of respondents saying very satisﬁed was 24±7%.

However, as the rest of Table 2reveals, Belgium is not typical.\\nDenmark, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Netherlands allrecord increases in the numbers of individuals saying they feel very satisﬁedwith life.

The new British Household Panel Study givesmental well-being scores from a form of psychiatric evaluation known as theGeneral Health Questionnaire. The ﬁrst sweep of the British Household PanelStudy provides information, for the year 1991, about a random sample of\\napproximately six thousand working Britons. One way to assess these people’sfeelings of subjective well-being is to use their scores from the General HealthQuestionnaire (GHQ) section of the survey. Argyle ( 1989) argues that a GHQ\\nassessment is one of the most reliable indicators of psychological distress or‘disutility’. In its simplest form this assessment weights the answers to thefollowing set of questions.\\nHave you recently:\\n*1. been able to concentrate on whatever you are doing?\\n2. lost much sleep over worry?\\n*3. felt that you are playing a useful part in things?\\n*4. felt capable of making decisions about things?\\n5. felt constantly under strain?\\n6. felt you couldn’t overcome your diﬃculties?\\n*7. been able to enjoy your normal day-to-day activities?\\n*8. been able to face up to your problems?\\n9. been feeling unhappy and depressed?\\n10. been losing conﬁdence in yourself?\\n11. been thinking of yourself as a worthless person?\\n*12. been feeling reasonably happy all things considered?\\nPeople’s answers to these questions are coded on a four-point scale running\\nfrom ‘disagree strongly’ to ‘agree strongly’. Starred items are coded in reverse,so that, for example, zero then corresponds to ‘agree strongly’. These twelveare then combined into a total GHQ level of mental distress in which highnumbers correspond to low feelings of well-being. The data provide a mentalstress or, much less accurately, unhappiness level for each individual in thesample.\\n#Royal Economic Society 1997the economic journal [novemberDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/107/445/1815/5063980 by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology user on 17 November 2024\\n1821 1997] happiness and economic performance\\nThere are various ways to work with GHQ responses. One is to calculate so-\\ncalled Caseness scores. These are produced by taking people’s answers to thetwelve questions that are listed above and summing the number of times theperson places himself or herself in either the fairly stressed or highly stressedcategory. With this method, the lowest possible level of well-being correspondsto a caseness level of 12(meaning that the individual felt stressed on every one\\nof the twelve questions). The highest level of well-being corresponds to 0\\n(meaning that the individual felt stressed on none of the twelve questions).Individuals with high caseness levels are viewed by psychologists as people whowould beneﬁt from psychiatric treatment.\\nThe British Household Panel Survey data show that income has no strong\\nrole to play, but that joblessness does.

There is, however, a methodof studying the other extreme.\\nSuicide is a signiﬁcant cause of death across the world. In Denmark it\\naccounts for approximately 1in every 3,000deaths; in Britain the ﬁgure is\\napproximately 1in every 12,000deaths; in the United States of America\\naround 1in every 7,000deaths are the result of suicide. Large numbers of\\npeople, therefore, take the decision that life is not worth living. Moreover, thenumbers just given understate what is really happening. First, most writings onthe subject express the view that, for understandable reasons, suicide statisticsare probably under-reported versions of the truth. Second, the number ofindividuals attempting suicide is much larger than of those who do killthemselves.\\nThe medical term for attempted suicide is para-suicide. Data in Smith\\n(1985) record the probably little-appreciated fact that in Britain a ﬁfth of all\\nemergency admissions to hospital are due to para-suicide. Dooley et al.(1989)\\nreport that para-suicide is between 8and20times more common than\\nsuccessful suicide. Five million Americans, they estimate, have attemptedsuicide at some time in their lives. The data that Platt and Kreitman ( 1985)\\ngather on Edinburgh males suggest that, among unemployed men in the lowestsocial class (Class V), one in twenty try to kill themselves in a given year.\\nIs this topic best left to doctors? Although analysis has a long history\\n(Durkheim, 1897, being a landmark), most social scientists are not used to\\nworking with suicide statistics. Economists, especially, are likely to see this areaas far from their usual concerns, and of little relevance to them.\\nThis attitude may not be the right one. As writer Wilfred Sheen remarked:\\nsuicide is about life, being in fact the sincerest criticism that life gets. If the aimis to understand human well-being and the value of life, suicide data oﬀer rich– though upsetting – information that would be impossible to glean in anyother way.

It might, of course, be argued by a socialscientist that suicide decisions are not rational. Perhaps they are simply a signof mental illness, and therefore do not contain reliable information. Medicalopinion has debated this view and not accepted it in a wholehearted way.There is evidence that suicides occur more frequently both among those whoin an objective sense have the least to live for, and after unpleasant events ina person’s life. The latter include unpleasant economic events. Humphry(1992) and Richman ( 1992) discuss the notion of, and evidence for, rational\\nsuicide.\\nFor the post-war period, suicide is dropping through time. By such a\\nbenchmark, life looks like it is improving. There is little reason to imputecausality, but the data do not contradict the natural idea that greater realincome might make fewer people so miserable that they want to kill themselves.Data for the whole century, in so far as they are reliable, suggest the same. In1911,2,600men committed suicide in England and Wales. In 1990,2,800did\\nso. The population over that period nearly doubled. In this sense, extremeunhappiness might be said to be dropping. Historical statistics also reveal thattotal suicide deaths reached their maximum in the Great Depression, which isconsistent with the idea that economics may have some role to play in this area.\\nFigure 2provides data on a dozen rich countries. Although it would\\nprobably be unwise to read too much into the plot, high real income ispositively, not negatively, correlated with the suicide rate.\\nTo explore the idea that money buys happiness, it might be natural to look\\nat data on suicide and low income.

In 1973, the proportion of British adults calling\\nthemselves very satisﬁed at work was 42±7%. In 1983, at the end of the period\\nfor which GHS data are available, the number was 39±3%. There is thus if\\nanything some sign of a slight fall in the level of job satisfaction in Britain.\\nThis ﬁnding of fairly ﬂat job satisfaction levels through time mirrors Weaver\\n(1980) on earlier US data. One interpretation, supported by the evidence in\\nClark and Oswald ( 1994), is that satisfaction is somehow inherently relativistic,\\nand based on comparisons with others.\\nFinding 7 .In Britain and America the le \\x8ael of job satisfaction is not rising o \\x8aer time.\\nv.conclusions\\nEvery day, in every industrialised country of the world, journalists and\\npoliticians give out a conscious and unconscious message. It is that bettereconomic performance means more happiness for a nation. This idea is rarelyquestioned. We feel we would be more cheery if our boss raised our pay, andassume that countries must be roughly the same.\\nThe results in this paper suggest that, in a developed nation, economic\\nprogress buys only a small amount of extra happiness. Four main pieces ofevidence have been oﬀered for this claim.\\n1. Reported happiness in the United States has gone up only fractionally\\nover the post-war period.\\n2. Reported levels of ‘satisfaction with life’ in Europe are only slightly\\nhigher than they were twenty years ago. Some countries show falls.\\n3. Although the rate of suicide in Britain has fallen by approximately one\\nthird over the last hundred years, the number for men has risen, in almost allWestern nations, from the 1970s to the present. Rich countries seem to have\\nhigh suicide rates.\\n4. Job satisfaction has not increased, over those parts of the last quarter of\\na century for which data are available, in the United States and the UnitedKingdom.\\nThese gains in national well-being appear to be so slight that a case could be\\nmade, as by Richard Easterlin ( 1974), that economic growth is worthless. This\\npaper argues that Easterlin is wrong – but only just.\\nBecause the task of measuring well-being is a diﬃcult and relatively\\nunconventional one, the paper’s results cannot be accepted uncritically. First,it might be argued that interview responses to happiness and satisfactionquestions do not mean anything reliable. Second, it might be argued that theuse of suicide data as an indicator of a society’s happiness is too strange to betaken seriously, or that such data are unhelpful because they are a reﬂection ofmental illness and not of any objectively low quality of life. There is no whollyconvincing way to dispose of such objections. As in any area of social science,it is prudent to view the paper’s punchlines cautiously. Nevertheless, a simplereply to critics is that these kinds of statistics are probably the only onesavailable to us if we wish to measure well-being, and that, at the very least, theyraise doubts about routine beliefs. Moreover, counter-arguments to the\\n#Royal Economic Society 1997Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/107/445/1815/5063980 by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology user on 17 November 2024\\n1828\\nmethodological criticisms have been produced many times. It is known in the\\npsychological and medical literatures that objective economic events arecorrelated with happiness scores and with suicide (and para-suicide).\\nAnother possible line of attack on the paper’s conclusions is to appeal to\\ncommon-sense observation. How can it be, one might ask, that money buyslittle well-being and yet we see individuals around us constantly striving tomake more of it? The answer may be that what matters to someone who livesin a rich country is his or her relative income. A spectator who leaps up at afootball match gets at ﬁrst a much better view of the game; by the time hisneighbours are up it is no better than before. If there is something to this, itwould explain why intuition is capable of misleading us about the nationalbeneﬁts of economic performance. Such intuition has been built up byobserving how each of us feels as our income rises. Yet, implicitly, that holdsothers’ incomes constant. Hence common-sense may not be a good guide towhat happens when a whole society gets richer.\\nThe conclusions of the paper do not mean that economic forces have little\\nimpact on people’s lives. A consistent theme through the paper’s diﬀerent formsof evidence has been the vulnerability of human beings to joblessness.Unemployment appears to be the primary economic source of unhappiness. Ifso, economic growth should not be a government’s primary concern.\\nUni\\x8aersit\\x92of War Wick\\nBackground notes\\nThe main sources of information used in the paper are the Eurobarometer Sur \\x8ae\\x92sof1973\\nonwards, the British General Household Sur \\x8ae\\x92sof1973onwards, the ﬁrst 1991sweep of\\ntheBritish Household Panel Stud \\x92, and the US General Social Sur \\x8ae\\x92sof1972onwards. These\\nare face-to-face surveys of randomly sampled individuals. Suicide data come from theOﬃce of Population Censuses and Surveys. All the paper’s sources of data are publiclyavailable. This paper has not attempted to document its literature sources in the waya normal academic paper would. The paper’s general conclusions in some cases agreeor overlap with those in Andrews ( 1991), Smith ( 1979), Shin ( 1980), Thomas and\\nHughes ( 1986), Veenhoven ( 1991,1993) and Weaver ( 1980). Although little-read by\\neconomists, the pioneering work on the statistical study of well-being includes Andrewsand Withey ( 1976), Andrews and Inglehart ( 1978), Campbell et al.(1976), Campbell\\n(1981), Cantril ( 1965), Diener ( 1984), and Larsen et al.(1984). A good introduction\\nis Argyle ( 1989). Economists interested in dipping into a huge recent literature might\\nalso look at Andrews ( 1991), Warr ( 1987,1990a,b) and Ng ( 1996). Blanchﬂower and\\nOswald ( 1996) conclude that the young are getting systematically happier. Birdi et al.\\n(1995), Clark et al.(1996) and Warr ( 1992) argue that job satisfaction is U-shaped in\\nage, and give other results. Blanchﬂower and Oswald ( 1997) ﬁnd the self-employed are\\nhappier.\\nHirsch ( 1976) is a well-known critique of the value of increased real national income.\\nScitovsky ( 1976) makes similar arguments. My attention has been drawn to an early\\nhappiness study in this J ournal , Morawetz et al.(1977). Many of the British results on\\nthe distress caused by unemployment are due to Jahoda ( 1982), Warr ( 1978onwards)\\nand Jackson et al.(1983). New work includes Whelan ( 1992) and Gallie and Russell\\n(1995). The unemployment ﬁndings are now conventional in the psychology literature\\n#Royal Economic Society 1997the economic journal [novemberDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/107/445/1815/5063980 by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology user on 17 November 2024\\n1829 1997] happiness and economic performance\\nbut probably still not well-known among economists. Innovative early work by\\neconomists includes Bjorklund ( 1985) and Edin ( 1988), who fail to ﬁnd marked eﬀects\\nfor Sweden. More recent research has uncovered large negative eﬀects of joblessnessupon wellbeing. The ﬁndings of Gerlach and Stephan ( 1996), Korpi ( 1997) and\\nWinkelmann and Winkelmann ( 1997) seem particularly important. They control for\\nperson-speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀects. The coeﬃcient on unemployment in a panel well-beingequation turns out to be fairly similar to that in a pure cross-section equation.\\nThere are potential links between the happiness literature and the literatures on the\\nquality of life and the Human Development Index, but they have yet to be forged.Nussbaum and Sen ( 1993) contains a set of essays on the border between philosophy\\nand economics. Smith ( 1993) is a critical inquiry into HDI. Crafts ( 1997) is a recent\\napplication of HDI methods.\\nIf well-being depends upon relative income, most of economists’ optimal tax theory\\nis incomplete or worse. The standard literature assumes that in setting taxes agovernment should pay no attention to people’s feelings of how they compare withothers: little or no role is assigned to personal notions of justice or relative deprivation.Some of the few attempts to change this are Boskin and Sheshinski ( 1978), Layard\\n(1980) and Oswald ( 1983).\\nInternational comparisons using the multi-national International Social Sur \\x8ae\\x92\\nProgramme are given in Birdi et al.(1995), Blanchﬂower and Freeman ( 1997) and\\nCurtice ( 1993). This paper focuses on well-being in developed countries. It seems likely\\nthat real income growth does buy a lot of happiness in a developing nation. Veenhoven(1991) presents evidence consistent with that.\\nReferences\\nAndrews, F. M.

Introduction\\n1.1.  Pathways\\nThere  are  at  least  three  reasons  for  thinking  that  experiences  of\\nnatural  environments  will  be  positively  related  to  health,\\nwellbeing  and  happiness.  First,  there  appear  to  be  direct  pathways\\nby  which  such  experiences  affect  the  nervous  system,  bringing\\nabout  stress  reduction  and  restoration  of  attention.  The  existence\\nof  such  pathways  –  biophilia  –  has  plausible  evolutionary\\nexplanations:  an  innate  human  emotional  afﬁliation  to  nature\\nand  living  organisms  in  general  is  proposed  as  an  adaptation  to  our\\nreliance  on  the  natural  environment  throughout  all  but  the  past\\n10,000  years  of  our  history  (Wilson,  1993 ).  Afﬁnities  with  morespeciﬁc  habitats,  including  savanna  and  forest,  have  similarly  been\\npostulated  on  the  basis  that  these  habitats  would  have  provided\\nour  hominin  ancestors  with  the  greatest  reproductive  success  (Falk\\nand  Balling,  2010;  Han,  2007 ).\\nSecond,  natural  environments  may  be  lower  in  environmental\\n‘bads’  that  have  signiﬁcant  negative  impacts  on  physical  and\\nmental  wellbeing,  which  in  turn  could  affect  happiness.  Adverse\\nhealth  effects  of  noise  and  air  pollution  are  well  documented.\\nChronic  trafﬁc  noise  exposure  in  urban  environments  can  cause\\nsevere  sleep  disturbance,  hearing  impairment,  tinnitus,  and  raised\\nstress  levels,  leading  to  high  blood  pressure,  coronary  heart\\ndisease,  stroke,  and  possibly  immune  system  and  birth  defects\\n(Passchier-Vermeer  and  Passchier,  2000 ).  Similarly,  air  pollution\\ncan  lead  to  a  wide  range  of  respiratory  and  cardiovascular\\nproblems  (Gouveia  and  Maisonet,  2005 ).  As  noted  by  Welsch\\n(2006) ,  this  link  does  not  require  that  individuals  are  conscious  of\\nthe  causal  relationship  between  an  environmental  problem  and\\ntheir  own  happiness.  However,  awareness  of  a  local  environmental\\nproblem,  and  of  its  negative  effects  on  human  and  ecosystem\\nhealth,  could  also  act  to  reduce  happiness  levels  directly  andGlobal  Environmental  Change  23  (2013)  992–1000\\nA  R  T  I  C  L  E  I  N  F  O\\nArticle  history:\\nReceived  9  May  2012\\nReceived  in  revised  form  15  March  2013\\nAccepted  23  March  2013\\nKeywords:\\nHappiness\\nSubjective  wellbeing\\nNatureGreen space\\nBlue  space\\nExperience  sampling  methodA  B  S  T  R  A  C  T\\nLinks  between  wellbeing  and  environmental  factors  are  of  growing  interest  in  psychology,  health,\\nconservation,  economics,  and  more  widely.  There  is  limited  evidence  that  green  or  natural  environments\\nare  positive  for  physical  and  mental  health  and  wellbeing.  We  present  a  new  and  unique  primary\\nresearch  study  exploring  the  relationship  between  momentary  subjective  wellbeing  (SWB)  and\\nindividuals’  immediate  environment  within  the  UK.  We  developed  and  applied  an  innovative  data\\ncollection  tool:  a  smartphone  app  that  signals  participants  at  random  moments,  presenting  a  brief\\nquestionnaire  while  using  satellite  positioning  (GPS)  to  determine  geographical  coordinates.  We  used\\nthis  to  collect  over  one  million  responses  from  more  than  20,000  participants.  Associating  GPS  response\\nlocations  with  objective  spatial  data,  we  estimate  a  model  relating  land  cover  to  SWB  using  only  the\\nwithin-individual  variation,  while  controlling  for  weather,  daylight,  activity,  companionship,  location\\ntype,  time,  day,  and  any  response  trend.

There  is  evidence  that  individuals’  perceptions  of\\nair  pollution  are  positively  correlated  with  objective  pollution\\nmeasures  (Day,  2007 ).  This  makes  individuals’  perceptions  of  air\\npollution  an  additional  route  by  which  the  pollution  may  inﬂuence\\ntheir  happiness.\\nThird,  natural  environments  might  increase  happiness  by\\nfacilitating  and  encouraging  –  for  practical,  cultural  and/or  psycho-\\nlogical  reasons  –  behaviours  that  are  physically  and  mentally\\nbeneﬁcial,  including  physical  exercise,  recreation  and  social  interac-\\ntion  (Barton  and  Pretty,  2010a;  Morris,  2003 ).\\n1.2.  Evidence\\nResearchers  have  pursued  both  observational  and  experimental\\nevidence  on  the  links  between  physical  or  mental  wellbeing  and\\nthe  natural  environment.  Observational  studies  have  related\\naveraged  wellbeing  measures  to  aggregate  environmental  char-\\nacteristics  between  geographical  regions  (e.g.  Mitchell  and\\nPopham,  2007,  2008;  Vemuri  and  Costanza,  2006;  Engelbrecht,\\n2009 ).  They  have  also  compared  individuals’  SWB  reports  or\\nmedical  records  with  the  proximity  of  their  homes  to  natural\\nenvironments,  or  with  alternative  indicators  of  local  environmen-\\ntal  quality  (e.g.  de  Vries  et  al.,  2003;  Kaplan,  2001;  Brereton  et  al.,\\n2008;  Rehdanz  and  Maddison,  2008;  Maas  et  al.,  2009 ).\\nExperimental  and  quasi-experimental  studies  have  investigated\\nphysiological  and  psychological  effects  of  exposure  to  images  of\\ndifferent  environment  types  (e.g.  Berto,  2005;  White  et  al.,  2010 )  or\\nto  short-term  interventions  bringing  subjects  into  contact  with\\nnature  (e.g.  Ryan  et  al.,  2010;  Hartig  et  al.,  2003;  Barton  and  Pretty,\\n2010b ).  They  have  also  related  health  outcomes  or  frequency  of\\nhealthcare-seeking  behaviour  to  views  of  nature  in  controlled\\ninstitutional  settings  (e.g.  Ulrich,  1984;  Moore,  1981 ).\\nMost  such  studies  report  beneﬁcial  impacts  of  natural  environ-\\nments  on  health  or  wellbeing,  but  they  have  some  common\\nweaknesses.  Observational  studies  measure  domestic  proximity  to\\nnatural  environments  but  not  actual  experiences  of  such  environ-\\nments  (which  may  not  occur  near  home,  and  may  occur  elsewhere);\\ncannot  provide  data  on  the  moment-by-moment  hedonic  or\\naffective  element  of  wellbeing;  and  are  commonly  reliant  on\\nretrospective  assessments  that  are  subject  to  substantial  recall  bias\\n(Robinson  and  Clore,  2002 ).  Experimental  studies  are  stronger  in\\nthese  respects  but,  by  their  nature,  have  lesser  ecological  validity  –\\nthat  is,  they  tell  us  a  limited  amount  about  people’s  real  experiences\\nof  natural  environments  in  their  everyday  lives.\\nLongitudinal  study  designs  in  which  participants  provide\\nongoing  reports  of  their  everyday  experience  –  Ecological\\nMomentary  Assessment  (EMA),  the  Experience  Sampling  Method\\n(ESM),  and  the  Day  Reconstruction  Method  (DRM)  –  provide  some\\nof  the  best  evidence  regarding  inﬂuences  on  wellbeing  in  general\\n(Shiffman  et  al.,  2008;  Hektner  et  al.,  2007;  Kahneman  et  al.,  2004 ).\\nHowever,  these  methods  have  conventionally  been  cumbersome,\\nexpensive,  and  limited  to  very  small  samples  (Killingsworth  and\\nGilbert,  2010 ).  They  have  also  been  unable  to  provide  objective\\nlocation  data.  For  these  reasons,  such  ongoing  assessment  methods\\nhave  not  previously  been  applied  to  the  study  of  wellbeing  in\\ndifferent  environments.\\nThis  paper  aims  to  address  some  of  the  shortcomings  of\\nprevious  research  and  improve  the  understanding  and  measure-\\nment  of  the  relationship  between  happiness  and  the  natural\\nenvironment.  We  explore  the  link  between  momentary,  experi-\\nenced  subjective  wellbeing  and  individuals’  immediate  environ-\\nment,  using  a  pioneering,  large-scale  ESM  study  in  the  UK.  We\\nfocus  on  land  cover,  including  green  and  blue  space  types.  Unlike\\nmost  previous  research  –  based  on  retrospective  evaluations  of\\nwellbeing  and  domestic  proximity  to  an  environment  –  our  study\\ncaptures  individuals’  momentary  experiences  of  both.1.3.  Structure  of  this  paper\\nThe  paper  proceeds  as  follows.  The  next  section  locates  our\\napproach  within  the  broader  context  of  happiness  and  wellbeing\\nresearch.  Section  3  describes  our  ESM  technique.  Section  4\\npresents  and  discusses  our  results,  including  a  variety  of\\nrobustness  checks.  Section  5  concludes,  summarizing  key  ﬁndings\\nand  discussing  the  potential  for  future  applications.\\n2.  Approach  to  happiness  and  wellbeing\\nA  variety  of  terms  are  used  in  the  cross-disciplinary  literature\\naround  happiness,  including  happiness,  (subjective)  wellbeing,  life\\nsatisfaction,  experienced  utility,  and  quality  of  life.  It  is  common\\nfor  several  such  terms  to  be  used  interchangeably,  as  synonyms,\\nand  also  for  the  same  terms  to  be  applied  to  different  concepts  or\\nquantities  –  such  as  the  results  of  quite  distinct  survey  questions  –\\nin  different  studies  (MacKerron,  2012b ).\\nA  variety  of  ways  to  conceive  of  happiness  and  wellbeing\\nare  available  too.  Dolan  and  Metcalfe  (2012)  provide  a  useful\\nsummary,  distinguishing  three  broad  accounts:  objective  lists,  in\\nwhich  wellbeing  is  the  fulﬁlment  of  a  ﬁxed  set  of  material,\\npsychological  and  social  needs,  identiﬁed  exogenously;  preference\\nsatisfaction ,  the  standard  economic  view,  in  which  wellbeing\\nconsists  in  the  freedom  and  resources  to  meet  one’s  own  wants  and\\ndesires;  and  happiness  or  subjective  wellbeing  (SWB),  in  which\\nwellbeing  is  measured  by  people’s  self-reports  in  response  to\\nappropriate  questioning.\\nThis  third  account,  SWB,  can  be  further  divided  into  three\\ncategories:  evaluative  SWB,  in  which  people  are  asked  for  global\\nassessments  of  their  lives  –  for  example,  their  ‘satisfaction  with  life\\nas  a  whole’;  eudemonic  SWB,  based  on  reports  concerning\\n‘ﬂourishing’,  purpose  and  meaning  in  life,  and  the  realization  of\\none’s  potential;  and  hedonic  or  experienced  SWB,  based  on  reports\\nof  mood,  affect  or  emotion,  and  representing  the  Benthamite,\\nUtilitarian  view  of  wellbeing  as  pleasure  and  pain.\\nAs  one  might  expect,  answers  across  the  three  categories  of\\nSWB  or  happiness  tend  to  be  positively  correlated  –  and  also\\nrelated  to  wellbeing  according  to  the  other  two  broad  accounts  –\\nbut  they  may  respond  differentially  to  different  external  factors,\\nsuch  as  income  (Kahneman  and  Deaton,  2010 ).  The  ESM  method\\nemployed  here  provides  particularly  rich  information  on  the  third\\ncategory  –  hedonic,  experienced  SWB.\\n3.  Methods\\n3.1.  Registration  and  experience  sampling\\nWe  developed  a  native  software  application  (app)  named\\nMappiness  for  Apple  iPhone,  iPad  and  iPod  devices  using  the  Apple\\nSoftware  Development  Kit  (Apple  Inc.,  2010 ).  We  also  developed\\nback-end  server  software  to  communicate  with  the  app,  and\\na  public-facing  website  providing  information  to  actual  and\\nprospective  respondents  (http://www.mappiness.org.uk ).  The  app\\nis  distributed  via  Apple’s  App  Store,  a  central  software  repository\\naccessible  to  all  device  users.\\nParticipants  are  self-selecting  and  recruited  opportunistically,\\nassisted  by  coverage  in  traditional  and  social  media.  The  app  was\\nhighlighted  in  the  App  Store  (in  the  Featured/New  section)  for  two\\nweeks  shortly  after  launch;  it  has  been  the  subject  of  thousands  of\\nmessages  on  the  social  networking  sites  Facebook  and  Twitter;\\nand  the  project  has  had  extensive  coverage  on  television,  radio,\\nand  in  the  specialist  and  mainstream  press.  The  app  is  also  well\\nadapted  to  spread  amongst  friends  and  acquaintances,  since  its\\nbeeps  may  interrupt  social  interaction  and  make  it  a  subject  of\\nconversation.G.  MacKerron,  S.  Mourato  /  Global  Environmental  Change  23  (2013)  992–1000  993Prospective  participants  download  the  Mappiness  app  at  no\\ncharge,  indicate  their  informed  consent  to  taking  part,  and  provide\\nbasic  demographic  and  health-related  information  (the  full\\nquestionnaire  is  reproduced  in  the  Supplementary  Material).  After\\nthis  registration  process,  they  are  then  signalled  (beeped)  at\\nrandom  moments  during  their  daily  lives,  with  a  frequency  and\\nduring  hours  they  choose  (the  defaults  are  twice  a  day  between\\n08.00  and  22.00),  and  asked  to  report  the  extent  to  which  they\\nare  feeling  ‘Happy’  on  a  continuous  sliding  scale.  Participants  are\\nalso  asked  whom  they  are  with,  where  they  are,  and  what  they\\nare  doing  (the  full  questionnaire  is  again  reproduced  in  the\\nSupplementary  Material,  and  example  screens  are  shown  in\\nFigure  S1  there).  While  they  answer,  precise  location  is  determined\\nby  satellite  positioning  (Global  Positioning  System,  GPS).  The\\nencrypted  data  is  then  transmitted  to  our  server.  Participants\\nreceive  simple  feedback,  charting  their  happiness  in  different\\ncontexts,  and  can  take  part  for  as  long  or  short  a  period  as  they\\nwish.\\nNecessary  conditions  for  receiving  a  valid  response  to  a  signal\\ninclude  that  the  signalled  participant  is:  in  possession  of  the\\npowered-on  signalling  device;  in  an  area  with  wireless  data\\nreception  (e.g.  not  on  an  underground  rail  system);  able  to  hear  the\\nsignal  (e.g.  not  in  a  noisy  club);  able  to  respond  (e.g.  not  driving);\\nand  willing  to  do  so.  Apart  from  wireless  data  reception,  these\\nsame  conditions  apply  to  all  signal-contingent  ESM  studies.  These\\nrequirements  will  inevitably  restrict  the  sample  of  experiences\\ncaptured  (wireless  data  reception  is  available  in  the  vast  majority\\nof  UK  locations,  but  is  regrettably  somewhat  less  widespread  in  the\\nmost  rural  and  remote  locations,  which  are  also  more  likely  to  be\\nnatural  environments).\\nRegarding  the  sample  of  individuals,  the  requirement  that\\nparticipants  own  an  iPhone,  and  that  they  self-select  into  the\\nstudy,  rules  out  obtaining  a  probability  sample,  or  even  one  that\\nis  representative  on  observable  characteristics  (we  describe  the\\ncharacteristics  of  our  sample  in  Section  4.1).  On  the  other  hand,\\nuse  of  the  iPhone  provides  substantial  advantages  over  tradi-\\ntional  ESM  protocols  using  paper  diaries  or  handheld  computers.\\nThe  device  is  small  and  convenient.  Since  it  is  already  owned  and\\nprovides  other  functions  to  the  user,  it  is  also  likely  to  be  kept\\ncharged,  switched  on,  and  within  reach  without  any  additional\\nburden  on  participants.  Responses  cannot  be  entered  for  any\\ntime  other  than  the  current  moment  (this  may  be  a  serious\\nproblem  in  diary-based  studies,  where  in  some  cases  a  large\\nproportion  of  responses  are  found  to  have  been  fabricated  long\\nbefore  or  after  the  signalling  time:  Stone  and  Shiffman,  2002 ).\\nAnd  the  relatively  low  burden  on  respondents,  and  low  marginal\\ncost  in  researcher  time  and  money  of  each  additional  respondent,\\nenable  a  sample  size  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  has\\ntraditionally  been  achievable.  A  more  detailed  treatment  of  the\\nmethods  outlined  in  this  section  is  provided  by  MacKerron\\n(2012a) .\\n3.2.  Spatial  data\\nWe  associate  each  response  with  three  key  spatial  and\\nenvironmental  indicators  using  the  GPS  location  data:  broad\\nhabitat  or  land  cover  type,  weather  conditions  and  daylight  status.\\nOur  main  focus  is  on  land  cover  (including  green  and  blue  space\\ntypes).  We  calculate  the  habitat  type  at  each  reported  point\\nlocation  using  the  25  m-resolution  UK  Land  Cover  Map  2000  (LCM)\\n(Fuller  et  al.,  2002 ),  grouping  LCM  subclasses  into  the  same  nine\\nbroad  habitat  categories  used  in  the  UK  NEA  (UK  National\\nEcosystem  Assessment,  2011 ).  These  categories  are  as  listed  in\\nTable  1,  and  their  composition  is  provided  in  Table  S1  in  the\\nSupplementary  Material.  Arguably,  nearby  habitats  might  also\\nform  part  of  a  respondent’s  experience.  However,  since  the  habitattypes  generally  occur  in  areas  much  larger  than  a  25  /C2  25  m\\nsquare,  we  believe  that  land  cover  type  at  the  respondent’s  point\\nlocation  represents  a  reasonable  proxy  for  the  habitat  that  the\\nrespondent  is  experiencing.\\nAs  an  important  control  variable,  we  also  assess  weather\\nconditions  at  the  reported  location  at  the  time  of  the  report.  Using\\ndata  from  Weather  Underground,  which  collates  data  from  280\\nweather  sensors  across  the  UK  several  times  per  day,  we  link  each\\nresponse  with  weather  conditions  reported  by  the  station  nearest\\nthe  response  location  at  the  moment  nearest  the  response\\ntimestamp.  Finally,  we  calculate  whether  it  was  daylight  at\\nthe  response  date,  time  and  location  using  the  NOAA  sunrise/\\nsunset  calculations  available  within  the  StreamMetabolism\\nlibrary  of  the  R  statistical  package  (Seﬁck,  2009;  R  Development\\nCore  Team,  2011 ).\\n3.3.  Data  scope  and  ﬁltering\\nOur  analysis  is  based  on  1,138,481  responses  from  21,947  UK\\nparticipants.  We  believe  these  sample  sizes  to  be  the  largest  ever\\nachieved  by  an  ESM  study.  The  responses  cover  a  period  of\\napproximately  six  months  from  the  app’s  launch  in  mid-August\\n2010  to  mid-February  2011,  and  are  validated  according  to  three\\ncriteria.  First,  they  must  be  prompted  by  a  signal:  we  identify  such\\nresponses  as  those  starting  within  60  min  of  a  previously\\nunanswered  signal,  and  completed  within  a  further  5  min.  To\\nensure  a  fully  random  sample  of  experiences,  we  would  ideally\\nlike  all  participants  to  respond  instantaneously  to  all  signals.  Since\\nthis  is  not  realistic,  varying  judgments  have  been  made  in\\nprevious  research  regarding  the  maximum  acceptable  response\\ndelay.  Our  60  min  cut-off  is  relatively  generous  in  relation  to\\nthe  EMA  literature:  Stone  and  Shiffman  (2002,  p.  239) ,  for\\nexample,  ‘‘would  be  uncomfortable  with  delays  of  30  min  or\\nmore’’.  To  ensure  robustness  of  our  ﬁndings,  we  therefore  ran\\nalternative  analyses  with  a  20  min  maximum  delay.  As  noted\\nbelow,  this  altered  delay  criterion  did  not  qualitatively  change\\nour  results.\\nSecond,  responses  must  have  a  UK  GPS  location  for  which,  if\\noutdoors,  the  device-reported  accuracy  is  /C6250  m  or  better.\\nThird,  local  weather  data  must  be  available  for  within  3  h  of  the\\nresponse  time.  In  an  ideal  world,  we  would  like  to  know  the\\ngeographical  coordinates  of  each  outdoor  response  with  absolute\\nprecision,  and  we  would  like  to  know  the  weather  conditions  at  that\\nlocation  at  the  precise  moment  of  responding.  In  practice  we  must\\nmake  a  trade-off  between  accuracy  and  exclusion  rate.  Our  choice\\nto  exclude  outdoor  responses  with  a  reported  accuracy  worse  than\\n/C6250  m  has  a  very  modest  effect  on  sample  size  (excluding  less\\nthan  0.25%,  or  just  over  4500  responses).  To  check  robustness,  we\\nran  alternative  analyses  in  which  results  were  excluded  if  reported\\naccuracy  was  worse  than  /C6100  m.  As  noted  below,  this  produced  no\\nqualitative  change  in  our  results.  We  accept  the  nearest  weather\\nstation  location  in  all  cases  –  the  distance  is  always  less  than\\n60  km  –  and  exclude  responses  only  in  the  very  rare  case  that\\ncomplete  weather  data  was  not  reported  by  that  station  within  3  h\\nof  (before  or  after)  the  response.\\nDescriptive  statistics  and  econometric  analyses  are  reported\\nfor  these  valid  responses  and  their  contributing  participants\\nonly.\\n3.4.  Econometric  model\\nThe  study  data  represent  a  very  large,  unbalanced  panel,  with\\nlarge  N  (the  number  of  individuals)  and  highly  variable  T  (the\\nnumber  of  assessments  per  individual).  We  use  the  data  to\\nestimate  a  ﬁxed  effects  or  within  estimator  model,  explaining  the\\nrelationship  of  habitat  type  and  other  environmental  variables  toG.  MacKerron,  S.  Mourato  /  Global  Environmental  Change  23  (2013)  992–1000 994happiness  self-ratings.  Speciﬁcally,  we  model  the  reported\\nhappiness  r  of  individual  i  at  location  l  and  time  t  as:\\nrilt¼  aiþ  b0\\nppiltþ  b0qqiltþ  eilt\\nwhere  a  is  an  individual-speciﬁc  constant  or  ﬁxed  effect,  p  is  a\\nvector  of  contextual  factors  such  as  companionship  and  activity,\\nq  is  a  vector  of  local  amenities  and  environmental  conditions\\n(which  may  vary  through  time),  and  e  is  an  error  term.  This  model\\nhas  participant-speciﬁc  intercepts  –  the  ﬁxed  effects  –  and  is\\nequivalent  to  an  OLS  regression  in  which  a  dummy  variable  is\\nincluded  for  each  participant.  The  ﬁxed  effects  control  for  all  time-\\ninvariant  individual-speciﬁc  characteristics,  including  personality\\ncharacteristics  and  demographic  variables  such  as  age  and  income\\n(e.g.  Wooldridge,  2009 ).  We  are  therefore  able  to  estimate  the\\ninﬂuence  of  the  natural  environment  on  self-reported  happiness\\nusing  only  variation  between  reports  from  the  same  individuals.\\nOn  the  left  hand  side  of  our  model,  the  happiness  self-rating  is\\nscaled  from  0  (‘not  at  all’)  to  100  (‘extremely’).  On  the  right  hand\\nside  we  include  dummies  for  habitat  types  when  outdoors,  which\\nare  the  focus  of  this  research.  However,  experience  of  different\\nenvironments  may  well  be  associated  with  other  variables  that  are\\nimportant  to  wellbeing.  For  example,  visits  to  parks  could  be\\ncorrelated  with  the  presence  of  family  and  friends,  leisure\\nactivities,  weekends,  and  good  weather.  We  therefore  include  as\\ncontrol  variables  the  indicators  of  daylight  and  weather  conditions\\nwhen  outdoors,  activity,  companionship,  location  type,  and  time  of\\nday  (separately  for  Monday  –  Friday  and  Saturday  –  Sunday).  We\\nalso  include  response  sequence  indicators,  capturing  the  number\\nof  previous  responses  by  the  same  participant,  to  control  for\\npossible  trends  in  happiness  (or  response  behaviour)  over  time.\\nWe  cannot  include  in  our  model  any  time-invariant  individual-\\nlevel  inﬂuences  on  reported  happiness,  such  as  personality\\ncharacteristics  or  gender,  since  all  such  inﬂuences  are  swept  upby  the  individual-level  ﬁxed  effects.  However,  the  estimator  allows\\nfor  arbitrary  correlation  between  any  individual  effects  (including\\nunobserved  effects)  and  the  observed  explanatory  variables.  This  is\\nan  important  property,  since  such  correlations  seem  likely  to  exist  in\\nour  data.  For  example,  personality  characteristics  may  very  plausibly\\nbe  associated  with  the  companionship,  activity  and  environment\\nthat  a  person  can  and  does  choose  at  any  moment  in  time.\\nBasic,  pooled  OLS  ﬁxed  effects  estimation  requires  that  the\\nerrors  are  homoskedastic  and  not  serially  correlated  (Wooldridge,\\n2009 ).  The  serial  correlation  restriction  is  likely  to  be  problematic\\nfor  our  data,  since  it  seems  highly  plausible  that  unobserved\\ninﬂuences  on  a  person’s  happiness  may  persist  from  one  response\\nto  the  next.  Therefore  standard  errors  are  calculated  using  the\\ncluster-robust  sandwich  estimator  (StataCorp,  2009 ),  which  is\\nrobust  in  the  face  of  heteroskedasticity  and  serial  correlation  of  the\\nerrors  (Stock  and  Watson,  2008 ).\\n4.

They  are  also\\nrelatively  young:  66%  are  aged  under  35,  and  95%  under  50,\\ncompared  to  29%  and  56%  respectively  in  the  UK  adult  population\\n(Ofﬁce  for  National  Statistics,  2010 ).  78%  of  participants  are  in\\nemployment  and  13%  are  in  full-time  education.  These  groups  are\\nover-represented  relative  to  the  UK  adult  population,  in  which\\nthe  proportions  are  respectively  57%  and  4%,  primarily  at  the\\nexpense  of  retired  people,  who  constitute  0.5%  of  participants  but\\n22%  of  the  population  (National  Centre  for  Social  Research,  2009 ).\\nParticipants’  sex  ratio  is  nearly  balanced,  however,  at  55%  male,Table  1\\nDescriptive  statistics  for  explanatory  variables.

Responses  come  from  across\\nthe  UK  but  are  concentrated  around  population  centres,  as  shown\\nin  Fig.  1.  In  total,  amongst  participants  who  contributed  at  least  one\\nvalid  response,  48%  of  signals  resulted  in  a  valid  response.\\nAll  explanatory  variables  in  our  analysis  are  0/1  dummies,  and\\nall  land  cover  type  and  weather  variables  are  interacted  with  being\\noutdoors.  Note  that  we  consider  land  cover,  weather  conditions\\nand  countryside  designation  status  only  as  interactions  with  being\\noutdoors.  Although  it  is  possible  that  these  variables  are  also\\nassociated  with  happiness  when  participants  are  indoors  or  in  a\\nvehicle,  the  same  direct  link  from  environmental  exposure  to  mood\\ncannot  be  posited  with  conﬁdence  in  these  cases.  In  addition,  when\\nparticipants  are  not  outdoors  their  location  is  less  accurately\\ndetermined  by  GPS,  making  these  joined  spatial  data  less  reliable.\\nThe  variables  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  The  happiness\\nresponse,  scaled  0–100,  has  a  mean  of  66.4  and  standard  deviationof  21.6:  as  is  typical  for  SWB  parameters,  its  distribution  is\\nnegatively  skewed.  The  distribution,  which  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  2,\\nalso  shows  two  artefacts  of  the  response  process:  spikes  at  the\\nabsolute  extremes  of  the  distribution,  where  the  response  slider  is\\nmoved  to  its  limit,  and  small  troughs  on  either  side  of  the  midpoint,\\nwhere  the  response  slider  is  most  commonly  either  left  in  its  initial\\nposition  or  moved  a  minimum  distance  to  the  left  or  right.\\nAs  described  further  below,  we  check  robustness  using  a  model\\nthat  accounts  for  the  spikes  at  the  extremes  as  representing  a\\nconsequence  of  response  scale  truncation.\\n4.2.  Fixed  effects  model\\nTable  2  presents  the  model.  All  control  variables  show\\nrelationships  with  the  happiness  score  that  are  intuitive  and\\n(where  applicable)  in  line  with  previous  research.  For  example,\\nparticipants  are  happier  at  home  than  at  work,  and  greater\\nhappiness  is  also  associated  with  higher  temperatures  and  lower\\nwind  speeds,  with  sunshine,  and  with  the  absence  of  rain  and\\nfog.  Physical  activities,  and  activities  expected  to  be  common  in\\nnatural  environments  (such  as  running,  gardening  or  birdwatch-\\ning),  also  show  substantial  positive  associations  with  happiness.\\nParticipants  are  happier  outdoors  than  indoors  or  in  a  vehicle.\\nWhen  outdoors,  every  habitat  type  except  inland  bare  ground  is\\nassociated  with  signiﬁcantly  higher  happiness  levels  than  the\\ncontinuous  urban  type.  Marine  and  coastal  margins  are  by  some\\ndistance  the  happiest  locations,  with  responses  approximately\\n6  points  higher  than  continuous  urban  environments  on  the  0–100\\nscale.  Alternatively  expressed,  this  is  a  difference  of  0.28  standard\\ndeviations,  or  one  of  similar  magnitude  to,  for  instance,  the\\ndifference  between  attending  an  exhibition  and  doing  housework.\\nAll  other  green  or  natural  environment  types  –  ‘mountains,\\nmoors,  and  heathlands’,  ‘freshwater,  wetlands  and  ﬂood  plains’,\\nwoodland,  grasslands,  and  farmland  –  are  between  2.7  and  1.8\\npoints  happier  than  continuous  urban  environments.  Suburban  or\\nrural  developed  environments  are  a  little  under  one  point  happier.\\nAs  noted  earlier,  we  cannot  include  in  our  model  any  time-\\ninvariant  individual-level  inﬂuences  on  reported  happiness,  such\\nas  gender  or  age,  since  all  such  inﬂuences  are  soaked  up  by  the\\nindividual-level  ﬁxed  effects.  However,  it  is  possible  to  include\\ninteractions  between  time-invariant  individual  characteristics  and\\nenvironmental  variables,  so  as  to  explore  the  existence  of  –  for\\nexample  –  gender  or  age  effects.  To  check  this,  we  ran  an  additional\\nﬁxed  effects  model  (not  shown)  adding  in  both  gender  and  age\\ninteractions  with  the  land  cover  variables.  We  had  no  prior\\nFig.  1.

Scenarios\\nCertain  activities,  such  as  gardening,  birdwatching,  hunting  and\\nﬁshing,  may  be  mainly  or  exclusively  carried  on  outdoors  and  in\\nnatural  environments.  And,  of  course,  people  may  be  more  likely\\nto  spend  time  in  natural  environments  in  pleasant  weather.\\nAssuming,  of  course,  that  our  model  is  correctly  speciﬁed  in  its\\ninclusion  of  these  variables  as  independent  effects,  we  may  simply\\nadd  coefﬁcients  together  to  predict  happiness  levels  in  speciﬁc\\nscenarios.  Thus,  for  example,  the  predicted  happiness  of  a  person\\nwho  is  outdoors  (þ2.32),  birdwatching  (þ4.32)  with  friends\\n(þ4.38),  in  heathland  (þ2.71),  on  a  hot  (þ5.13)  and  sunny\\n(þ0.46)  Sunday  early  afternoon  (þ4.30)  is  approximately  26  scale\\npoints  (or  1.2  standard  deviations)  higher  than  that  of  someone\\nwho  is  commuting  (/C02.03),  on  his  or  her  own,  in  a  city,  in  a  vehicle,\\non  a  cold,  grey,  early  weekday  morning.  Equivalently,  this  is  a\\ndifference  of  about  the  same  size  as  between  being  ill  in  bed\\n(/C019.65)  vs  doing  physical  exercise  (þ6.51),  keeping  all  other\\nfactors  the  same.4.4.  Robustness  checks\\nWe  have  performed  a  number  of  robustness  checks  on  these\\nresults.\\nAs  an  alternative  approach  to  identifying  high-quality  natural\\nenvironments,  we  re-ran  the  model  replacing  the  LCM  habitat\\nvariables  with  three  (in  some  cases  overlapping)  indicators  of  UK\\nlandscape  designations,  interacted  with  being  outdoors.  The\\ndesignated  areas  were:  Areas  of  Outstanding  Natural  Beauty\\n(AONB  –  including  the  Scottish  equivalent,  National  Scenic  Areas),\\nwith  2462  outdoor  responses;  National  Parks  (NP),  with  1402\\noutdoor  responses;  and  National  Nature  Reserves  (NNR),  with  117\\noutdoor  responses.  All  three  designations  were  positively  and\\nsigniﬁcantly  related  to  happiness  ratings  (AONB  coeff.  2.39,  std.  err.\\n0.55,  p  <  0.0001;  NP  coeff.  4.59,  std.  err.  0.58,  p  <  0.0001;  NNR\\ncoeff.  5.00,  std.  err.  1.62,  p  =  0.0020).\\nWe  tested  the  effect  of  imposing  more  stringent  response\\nvalidity  criteria,  requiring  responses  to  be  made  within  20  min  of  a\\nsignal  instead  of  60  min,  and  reported  accuracy  to  be  100  m  or\\nbetter  instead  of  250  m.  These  criteria  reduce  the  response  sample\\nsize  by  just  under  half.  The  sign  and  signiﬁcance  of  all  LCM  habitat\\nvariable  coefﬁcients  are  unchanged  in  this  regression  relative  to\\nthat  reported  in  Table  2,  and  no  coefﬁcient  varies  by  more  than  0.5\\nbetween  the  two.\\nIn  order  to  attract  and  motivate  prospective  participants  to  sign\\nup  to  the  study,  and  to  keep  them  engaged  in  taking  part,  we\\nprovided  some  feedback  about  their  responses  –  that  is,  some  basic\\ninformation  about  their  reported  happiness.

However,  taking  part  in  the  study  for  long  periods  of  time\\ncould  conceivably  lead  to  increased  reﬂection  on  states  of  mind,\\nand  awareness  of  the  factors  that  affect  these,  enabling  partici-\\npants  to  act  to  improve  their  mood.  To  test  whether  giving\\nfeedback  to  participants  over  a  prolonged  period  might  have\\naffected  responses  in  such  a  way  as  to  alter  our  ﬁndings,  we  ran  a\\nseparate  ﬁxed  effects  model  using  each  individual’s  ﬁrst  ten\\nresponses  only.  The  pattern  of  results  is  broadly  similar  to  that  in\\nTable  2,  providing  no  compelling  evidence  of  information  feedback\\neffects.\\nIt  is  also  conceivable  that  current  mood  might  have  an  effect  on\\nthe  likelihood  of  responding  to  the  Mappiness  app  when  prompted.\\nOr,  perhaps  more  likely,  it  may  be  that  participants  initially\\nrespond  to  signals  assiduously  and  irrespective  of  mood,  but  in\\nlater  stages  are  more  inclined  to  respond  when  feeling  good  (we\\nhave  received  correspondence  from  participants  supporting  this\\nlatter  possibility).  These  hypothesis  have  so  far  proven  difﬁcult  to\\ntest  with  our  data.  However,  the  model  we  ran  based  on  the  ﬁrst\\nten  responses  only  would  suggest  that,  if  later  stage  selection\\neffects  do  exist,  they  do  not  affect  the  links  we  ﬁnd  between  mood\\nand  environment.\\nWe  ran  an  interval  regression  model  accounting  for  the\\ntruncation  of  happiness  ratings  at  either  extreme  of  the  scale\\n(10,582  responses  at  zero  and  80,994  at  100),  seen  as  the  spikes  in\\nFig.  2.  We  do  not  use  this  as  our  main  model  because  ﬁxed  effects\\ncannot  be  included.  However,  in  this  model  all  natural  land  cover\\ncoefﬁcients  are  slightly  increased  in  magnitude,  and  all  remain\\nhighly  signiﬁcant.\\nAs  an  additional  test  we  focused  on  a  speciﬁc  activity,  modelling\\nparticipants’  happiness  when  undertaking  that  activity  in  natural\\nvs  urban  areas.  We  used  the  activity  labelled  ‘Sports,  running,\\nexercise’,  which  is  undertaken  in  areas  of  both  kinds.  In  order  to\\ninvestigate  possible  differences  in  self-reported  happiness  be-\\ntween  people  exercising  in  urban  areas  and  other  habitats,  we  re-\\nran  our  ﬁxed  effects  model  using  only  the  sub-sample  of  reports\\nlisting  this  amongst  current  activities  (11,653  reports  from  5085\\nindividuals).  Our  results  indicate  that  the  same  people  are  happier\\nwhen  they  are  exercising  in  ‘semi-natural  grasslands’  than  when\\nthey  are  doing  so  in  an  urban  environment.  The  other  habitat  types\\ndo  not  have  a  signiﬁcant  relationship  with  happiness  in  this  case,\\nbut  this  may  well  be  a  consequence  of  the  very  much  reduced\\nsample  size.\\nThough  we  include  a  wide  range  of  control  variables  in  our\\nhappiness  model,  we  do  not  ask  whether  participants  are  on\\nholiday.  If  participants  are  more  likely  to  visit  remote,  high-EQ\\nenvironments  when  on  holiday,  then  it  is  possible  that  happiness\\neffects  we  have  attributed  to  natural  environments  are  actually\\ndue,  in  whole  or  in  part,  to  enjoyment  of  such  leisure  time.  To  help\\naddress  this  issue  we  re-estimated  the  model  using  only  responses\\nreceived  on  weekends  and  public  holidays,  when  the  great\\nmajority  of  respondents  are  ‘on  vacation’  in  the  sense  that  they\\nare  presumably  free  to  engage  in  leisure  activities.  This  restriction\\nreduces  the  response  sample  size  by  about  two-thirds.  All  LCM\\ntype  coefﬁcients  remain  positive.  Coefﬁcients  on  all  green  and  blue\\nspace  types  are  reduced  somewhat  in  magnitude,  however,  and\\nthose  on  the  ‘mountains,  moors,  and  heathlands’  and  ‘freshwater,\\nwetlands,  and  ﬂoodplains’  types  are  no  longer  signiﬁcantly\\ndifferent  from  zero  at  the  5%  level.\\nFinally,  meaningful  hypothesis  testing  requires  that  the\\nsigniﬁcance  level  be  a  decreasing  function  of  sample  size  (Leamer,\\n1978 ),  and  our  sample  size  is  very  large.  In  addition,  in\\ninterpreting  our  coefﬁcients  of  interest,  we  are  making  multiple\\ncomparisons.  We  can  account  for  the  ﬁrst  issue  by  using  the\\nnatural  log  of  the  sample  size  as  a  higher-than-usual  critical  F\\nvalue  when  testing  whether  each  coefﬁcient  is  different  from  zero(Deaton,  1997 ).  We  can  account  for  the  second  using  the\\nBonferroni  correction,  dividing  the  signiﬁcance  threshold\\n(p  <  0.05)  by  the  number  of  tests  (Abdi,  2007 ).  Coefﬁcients  on\\nall  green  or  natural  land  cover  types  except  two  –  again,  the\\nmountain  and  freshwater  environment  types  –  retain  signiﬁcance\\neven  using  the  substantially  more  stringent  thresholds  calculated\\nusing  these  procedures.\\n5.  Conclusions\\n5.1.  Main  results\\nThis  study  provides  a  new  line  of  evidence  on  the  links  between\\nnature  and  subjective  wellbeing.  Amongst  study  participants,\\nhappiness  is  greater  in  natural  environments,  even  after  control-\\nling  for  a  wide  range  of  potential  confounders.\\nThe  relationships  we  estimate  are  highly  statistically  signiﬁ-\\ncant,  and  their  magnitudes  are  substantial.  We  know  that  the\\nrelationships  are  not  confounded  at  the  participant  level  (that  is,  by\\nassociations  between  types  of  locations  and  types  of  people),\\nbecause  our  model  is  estimated  exclusively  from  within-individual\\nvariation.  And  we  have  controlled  for  a  reasonably  comprehensive\\nset  of  potential  confounders  at  the  response  level.\\n5.2.  Limitations\\nCausal  pathways  may  run  in  both  directions,  such  that  people\\nchoose  an  environment  partly  according  to  their  mood  (for\\nexample,  individuals  who  already  feel  unhappy  may  be  less  likely\\nto  leave  the  home  to  engage  in  physical  activity  or  experience\\nnatural  habitats),  and  people’s  moods  are  partly  determined  by\\ntheir  environment.  It  seems  plausible  that  the  latter  pathway\\nmakes  an  important  contribution  to  the  relationship,  and  future\\nresearch  using  these  data  will  address  this  in  greater  detail.\\nOur  sample  is  limited  to  iPhone  users  who  encounter  the\\nopportunity  to  participate  in  the  study,  and  who  then  self-select.\\nWe  did  not  expect  to  obtain  a  sample  that  is  representative  of  the\\npopulation  as  a  whole,  and  indeed  we  did  not  obtain  one.  Caution\\nis  thus  required  in  making  any  claims  as  to  the  general\\napplicability  of  our  results.  On  the  one  hand,  we  do  not  know\\nof  any  evidence  that  the  demographic  peculiarities  of  our  sample\\n–  who  are  younger,  richer,  and  more  likely  to  be  in  education  or\\nemployment  than  average  –  should  affect  relationships  between\\ntheir  happiness  and  natural  environments.  On  the  other  hand,\\nwe  can  speculate  on  possible  effects  in  both  directions.  For\\nexample,  it  might  be  that  the  base  category  urban  environments\\nfrequented  by  our  respondents  are,  in  fact,  nicer  than  the  average,\\nwhich  could  lead  to  an  under-estimation  of  the  positive  links\\nwith  other  land  cover  types.  Conversely,  it  could  be  that  natural\\nenvironments  provide  a  particularly  strong  and  enjoyable\\ncontrast  with  the  stressful  working  lives  of  young  professionals,\\nwho  are  over-represented  in  our  sample,  leading  to  an  over-\\nestimation  of  those  same  links.\\nSelf-selection  might  affect  the  generality  our  ﬁndings  if  there\\nwere  meaningful  differentials  in  individuals’  sensitivity  to  the\\nenvironmental  characteristics  we  examine,  and  if  these  differ-\\nentials  played  a  part  in  individuals’  decisions  to  participate  in  the\\nstudy.  We  do  not  know  whether  or  to  what  extent  this  may  be\\nthe  case.\\n5.3.  Policy\\nThese  results  have  informed  the  UK  NEA  (Pretty  et  al.,  2011 ),\\nand  there  is  great  potential  for  further  developing  Mappiness ,  or\\nsimilar  tools,  for  use  in  a  wide  range  of  environmental  and  policy\\napplications.G.  MacKerron,  S.  Mourato  /  Global  Environmental  Change  23  (2013)  992–1000 998They  could  be  used  to  measure  the  effects  of  environmental\\ninterventions  –  such  as  the  creation  of  a  new  woodland,  clean-up  of\\na  contaminated  site,  introduction  of  a  community  conservation\\nprogramme,  or  start  of  a  green  exercise  programme  –  on\\nmomentary  wellbeing.  They  could  be  used  to  investigate  how\\npersistent  such  effects  are  over  time,  and  whether  these\\ninterventions  are  more  beneﬁcial  in  certain  geographical  sur-\\nroundings:  for  example,  measuring  the  differential  impact  on\\nsubjective  well-being  from  establishing  a  new  woodland  in  a\\nrural  location,  close  to  a  city,  near  a  deprived  area,  and  so  on.\\nMoreover,  with  some  straightforward  modiﬁcations,  similar\\ntools  could  be  developed  speciﬁcally  to  monitor  other  aspects\\nof  wellbeing,  including  mental  health,  evaluative  and  eudemonic\\nmeasures.\\nSimilarly,  tools  like  ours  could  be  used  to  quantify  and  assess\\nthe  impacts  on  wellbeing  of  environmental  hazards  or  disasters,\\nsuch  as  oil  spills,  forest  ﬁres,  epidemics  (e.g.  foot-and-mouth\\ndisease),  water  or  soil  contamination  incidents,  and  ﬂoods.  Future\\nversions  of  Mappiness  could  be  developed  to  investigate  human\\nresilience  in  relation  to  external  stresses  arising  from  environ-\\nmental  change  –  in  other  words,  the  ability  of  a  person  or\\ncommunity  to  withstand,  respond  and  recover  from  external\\nunfavourable  shocks,  as  well  as  the  capacity  to  self-organise  and\\nadapt  to  emerging  circumstances  (Adger,  2000,  2006;  Folke,  2006 ).\\nThis  could  allow  us  to  measure  day-to-day  ﬂuctuations  in  well-\\nbeing  and  relate  these  to  adversity  or  stresses  in  life  and  to  a\\nperson’s  resilience.\\nFinally,  there  is  also  great  potential  for  using  these  tools  to\\nenhance  citizen  science  projects  in  which  scientiﬁc  measurements\\nare  carried  out  by  volunteer  members  of  local  communities,  with\\nthe  aim  of  developing  an  evidence  base  –  that  may  then  inform\\naction  –  regarding  environmental  problems  in  their  area.  Mappi-\\nness  is  a  form  of  participatory  sensing,  a  developing  area  of  citizen\\nscience  in  which  the  capabilities  of  participants’  mobile  devices  are\\nused  to  sense  the  environment  (Haklay,  2012 ).  A  particularly\\npromising  application  here  lies  in  combining  behavioural  and\\nwellbeing  information  collected  in  this  way  with  emerging  locally-\\nbased  natural  resource  monitoring  efforts  in  developing  countries\\n(Fry,  2011 ).  With  the  aid  of  mobile  devices  equipped  with  GPS,\\ntools  for  ecological  measurement,  and  Mappiness ,  local  populations\\ncould  collect  real-time  information  on  ecological  change  (such  as\\nresource  damage  from  logging,  poaching,  water  pollution,  reef\\ndestruction  or  bushmeat  hunting)  –  as  is  currently  being  trialled\\nacross  many  parts  of  the  globe  –  whilst  simultaneously  measuring\\nthe  associated  wellbeing,  health  and  behavioural  changes.  The\\nprecise  way  in  which  wellbeing  would  be  conceptualized  and\\nmeasured  using  this  method  could  be  decided  collaboratively  with\\nthe  local  population,  ensuring  it  would  be  meaningful  and\\nappropriate  to  context.  Participatory  sensing  tools  of  this  kind\\ncould  also  be  adapted  to  allow  engagement  with  non-literate\\npeople.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe  thank:  Steve  Gibbons,  David  Maddison,  Francesca  Corna-\\nglia,  Jouni  Kuha,  Raphael  Calel,  Antoine  Dechezlepre ˆtre,  and  Rich\\nAston;  all  beta  testers  of  the  iPhone  app;  all  Mappiness  study\\nparticipants;  and  two  anonymous  reviewers.
