DATA PREPROCESSING AND CLEANING

Approach:
1. Air Pollutants: The data is until 2019 only (change the dataset to I cannot find another at this moment)
2. Russia: 2022 CPI using the average value from the past 5 years
3. Energy Consumption: Fill the missing data as 0

Code:
1. Variable.py is used to story all the relative path information, year list and the number of countries that will be extracted (maximun 30)
2. After setting the variables, click the LargeMain.py's run button
3. The output will be within the Cleaned Data folder which separates into different years and the concatenated across 2015 - 2022
